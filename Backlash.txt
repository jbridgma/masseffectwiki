Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Recharge speed is based off damage absorbed by the aegis, with less damage absorbed resulting in a quicker recharge speed. Absorbing no damage will result in a near-instant recharge.
Backlash can be sustained while moving and jumping, but not while sprinting or dashing.
Backlash can also be sustained when scoping, so it can be used to safely line up shots with sniper rifles.
Projectiles will be reflected wherever the player is aiming, meaning one enemy's projectiles can be reflected onto another enemy.
Strategies
Backlash is particularly powerful against enemies that continuously shoot, such as Observers, Destroyers, and Anointed. Reflecting their damage back at them quickly strips off their shields and leaves them vulnerable to other attacks.
Most staggering attacks, such as a Berserker's Flak Cannon or a Hydra's missiles, can only be absorbed by Backlash until it breaks. Ascendant energy orbs and siege mode Nullifier attacks, however, can be reflected back at them.
The skill is handy with its user at the forefront and the teammates at the rear especially during the extraction wave with lots of enemy fire all around.
Enemies presented with Backlash may hesitate to shoot if they aren't shooting yet. This doesn't apply to melee attackers like Adhi though.
The Sentinel and Explorer profiles work best with this skill as the bonuses each Profile provides to Power Restoration and Defense will also improve Backlash's strength.
