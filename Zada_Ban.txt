Description[]
Zada Ban is a large, dense planet named for a volus god of punishment. Its crust is rich in uranium, eroded by winds to create large radioactive dust storms across its surface. The volus of Talis Fia have explored the planet thoroughly with space probes and telepresent robo-mining machines, and discovered they are not the first to exploit the planet. Plastics from a mining station approximately 50,000 years old can be found near the planet's equator. Curiously, the mines nearby were not tapped out of uranium ore; they were instead abandoned at the height of their operation.

Trivia[]
Much like the planet Gei Hinnom and the moon Sinmara, two other celestial objects with Assignments, there is inconsistency between the object description and the actual surface: Zada Ban is described as having "large radioactive dust storms" and "zero atmospheric pressure" (two contradictory terms in itself as one cannot have winds if the planet is airless) but upon landing it appears to be a garden world as evidenced by the greenery in the assignment's environment.
