Mass Effect (cut)


Matthew Baudelaire is a character who was cut from Mass Effect. He was going to be a prostitute on Caleston, and could only engage in conversation with a female Commander Shepard, while a male Shepard would have to talk to Maddie Kedward.
Like his female counterpart, Matthew originates from Earth and ended up on Caleston thanks to the Union and the "contractual transit" system, an agreement that allows destitute citizens of Earth to travel to a colony. In exchange, Matthew ended up working as a prostitute to pay the Union back. Unlike Maddie however, Matthew appears to love working as a prostitute, and apparently continues to do it even if the Union is taken down.[1] He can offer some insight into the situation between Jason Harrah and Tatiana Naidenov to Shepard.[2]
In an alternative plotline, another cut assignment called Caleston: Free Prostitutes would have allowed Shepard to free Maddie and Matthew from their contractual obligations.
