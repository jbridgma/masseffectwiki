Hallerj is an angaran engineer and surveyor working out of Pelaav Research Station on Havarl. 







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




When Hallerj meets Pathfinder Ryder, he is working not far outside Daar Pelaav to control a fuel line fire. He warms Ryder of the dangers of the zone. He explains that the fire is caused by Havarl's strong wildlife who overtook and destroyed, above and below, the old and larger angaran settlement on the planet. According to him, plant roots ruptured an underground fuel pipeline and a stray spark lit the fires.
His current task is to avoid that the fires get worse by divert fuel from the damaged lines. Hallerj thinks that it could eventually stop the flames.
