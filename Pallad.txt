Pallads are buglike creatures that exist in the Heleus Cluster. They are a source of Soft Chitin, a useful biological resource. 
They apparently come in at least two variants: normal-sized pallads and miniature pallads. Miniature pallads superficially resemble and are at roughly the same size range as pale arknids without setae: six legs, two eyes on either side of the head (plus possibly two more on the forehead), and a giant abdomen. They are also known to be docile.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




A miniature pallad may have snuck aboard the Nexus from Eos through a shuttle, gorging on power wires and causing intermittent outages. Should Pathfinder Ryder investigate the problem, they discover the creature in Nakmor Kesh's office building a nest from foraged mechanical scraps, and then have the option to capture or kill it. It is sent to Professor Herik if captured.

Trivia[]
No pallads other than the miniature pallad can actually be seen in Mass Effect: Andromeda, and thus cannot actually be hunted for bio materials.
