Prerequisite: Meet the Resistance

Going straight north from Techiix on Voeld, there is red smoke from a flare among ice formations. Next to it is an audio log on the ground from a girl. Listening to the log starts the mission and Ryder receives +270 XP. 
Alternatively, you can discover the girl's parents' log instead if the marker and the daughter's log aren't around. It's on a small cave on the side of the mountain southeast from the center-north Forward Station, between it and a Remnant site. This switches the order of the objectives but there are no differences in the rewards or outcome.

Find the missing daughter[]
In the message, Ibyl says that she had to leave her parents in a nearby cave, while she herself was on the run from kett. They've already taken her acquaintances Oren and Ulri, and she hears them coming for her. 
A navpoint will be added to the cave location. Before you go, there's a lithium node in a nearby ice column.

Find the missing parents[]
In the cave, there is an audio log from Ibyl's father Relmoj. Listen to the audio log and Ryder receives +270 XP. The kett have taken Relmoj and Eira's children except Ibyl, so they sent her ahead to Techiix. He hears the kett coming for him and his wife.
Be prepared as a pack of Wraith will spawn in/around the cave entrance after Ryder listens to the father's audio log.
When you get both logs, Ryder has no way to track them so all that remains is to transmit the audio logs to the Resistance.
