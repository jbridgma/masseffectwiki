Paradise Sands refers to the expanse of desert surrounding the local watering hole The Paradise on Elaaden. It includes all artificial structures adjacent to Paradise itself, and serves as the Tempest's initial landing zone  on the world.
Initially sporting a heat hazard like the rest of the moon, there's no shade in the area apart from the buildings, a few trees, and two Forward Stations: north and west from the Tempest. The water tanks in Paradise Sands belong to the angaran merchant Annea, who deliberately placed them close to the cliffs as a psychological deterrent from theft.
There are a few nodes of fluorite scattered about on Paradise's territory. Farther out into the sands, there are mining zones rich in element zero, graphite, and iron. 
Paradise Sands encompasses the southernmost explorable regions of the moon as of 2819 CE. It is bounded by the Sea of Ataraxia at the westernmost and northeastern ends, massive cliffs to the south, New Tuchanka to the north, and northwest from the Paradise either Languish or Gehenna Valley depending on route.
