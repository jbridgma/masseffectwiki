Description[]
Ammut is an enormous hydrogen-helium gas giant with a mass approximately nine times that of Jupiter and nearly 2,900 times that of Earth. Despite massive pressure its core has failed to ignite in a fusion reaction, qualifying it as a failed star. It is believed to have captured all other planet-sized bodies in the solar system as moons or in impact events leading to its name, which means "Devourer". Unintimidated by this phenomena, the geth have colonized many of Ammut's moons and skim the hydrogen from Ammut's upper atmosphere.
TRAVEL ADVISORY: Ammut is in geth space. All civilian traffic is prohibited.
