Restrictions[]
Though all ranged weapons can have the double mod extension incorporated during crafting, there are weapons where the added mod slots can't be used. 
There are only four Mods for shotguns. 

The Scattershot can't use a Shotgun Clip Mod, so there is no point in adding a Double Mod Extension augmentation to the Scattershot to add 2 extra mods slots.
The Venom can't use a Shotgun Receiver Mod, so there is no point in adding a Double Mod Extension augmentation to the Venom to add 2 extra mods slots.
There are only five Mods for sniper rifles.

The Shadow can't use a Sniper Rifle Clip Mod or a Sniper Rifle Receiver Mod, so there is no point in adding a Double Mod Extension augmentation to the Shadow to add 2 extra mods slots.
