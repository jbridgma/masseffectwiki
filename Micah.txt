Micah's gas giants are believed to be extrasolar captures. Three of its asteroids are named the "eezo trio" as they all formed around an eezo core and have significant amounts of the substance. Iridium is also found in this system in abundance.
The quarians have mining operations here in 2185. Elohi is believed to be a piracy hotbed due to a large number of distress signals emanating from its vicinity.
