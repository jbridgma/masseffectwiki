Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Containment will only work if Ryder is actively using Biotic Skills.
Strategies
Unarmored/shielded enemies can be easily dealt with using most biotic powers, but this skill tree takes that concept even further, allowing Ryder to ignore multiple enemies while they are floating or trigger more efficient combos.
