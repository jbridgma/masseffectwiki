Description[]
Edolus is a terrestrial planet with an atmosphere of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Edolus' surface is covered by wide deserts of silicate sand, with only a few areas of igneous rock highlands to break the abrasive, dust-choked wind.
Edolus' orbit is congested with debris thrown inwards by the gravity of the gas giant Ontamalca. Due to a high rate of meteor impacts, exploration is highly dangerous.

Properties[]
The operational area on Edolus has a dusty breeze that only slightly impairs visibility. Hilly but lacking in steep inclines, going from point A to point B in a straight line shouldn't take too much time.
