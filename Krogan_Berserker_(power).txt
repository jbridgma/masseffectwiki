Rank 4
Evolves Krogan Berserker into one of the following options:

Krogan Pureblood[]
Grunt's mastery of his blood rage increases his already fantastic regeneration rate, letting him survive wounds that would kill other krogan.
Health: +50.00%
Weapon Damage: +15.00%
Health Regeneration: 55.00 points per second
Krogan Warlord[]
Grunt can go berserk without losing his lethal focus, increasing his weapon damage.
Health: +50.00%
Weapon Damage: +25.00%
Health Regeneration: 40.00 points per second
Player Notes[]
Arguments can be made for both evolutions of Krogan Berserker. Grunt is unable to max out Incendiary Ammo, Fortification, and Krogan Berserker at the same time, so it's not possible to maximize both his weapon damage and his survivability—you must choose one or the other. In general, survivability is the way to go on higher difficulties; Krogan Pureblood allows Grunt to regenerate almost 10% of his (upgraded) health every second.
