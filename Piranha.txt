Description[]
The N7 Piranha is an assault shotgun designed for the Reaper war. When the N7 program began training alien resistance forces, the lighter-bodied species wanted a low-recoil weapon with a wide pellet spread for dealing with hordes of husks. The result was the Piranha, which hit a sweet spot in close-range firepower. Its rapid-fire capability tears apart not only husks but most opponents unlucky enough to be in its way.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
The N7 Piranha is available after downloading the Mass Effect 3: Groundside Resistance Pack.
In the Legendary Edition it is available from the Spectre Requisitions terminal in the Citadel Embassies for a base amount of 125,000 credits.

Multiplayer
Weapons are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The N7 Piranha is categorized as rare and requires the Mass Effect 3: Earth DLC pack.

Player Notes[]
GeneralSingle-playerMultiplayer
General
The Piranha is a fully automatic shotgun, and unlike its cousin the M-27 Scimitar, the Piranha has the same rate of fire whether the trigger is held down or pumped rapidly in semi-auto fashion.
The Piranha is essentially a Scimitar that packs a heavier punch at the cost of also being heavier, weighing the same as the M-11 Wraith and the M-96 Mattock assault rifle. This is still on the lighter end of the shotgun class.
The Piranha has an eight shot capacity and a good amount of reserve ammo. The large magazine makes it more suitable for sustained combat, whereas most shotguns force the user to retreat after firing to reload. This also makes it a little more forgiving of missed shots.
The main weakness of the Piranha is its relatively low damage-per-shot for a shotgun, requiring more shots on average to kill targets.
The Piranha's shots scatter pellets in a wider spread pattern than the Scimitar. The Shotgun Smart Choke is almost required for the weapon to be effective outside of point-blank ranges, making it easier to concentrate damage on enemy heads or weak points.
Aiming down sights (zooming) changes the reticle to a more easily visible circle, but this has no impact on the spread or accuracy of the weapon. As with most shotguns, firing from cover likewise provides no benefit to accuracy.
The Marksman power is one of the only ways to improve the accuracy of a shotgun outside of equipping the Smart Choke mod, and it is particularly devastating in tandem with the Piranha thanks to the weapon's large magazine size, minimizing the amount of time spent reloading. Combining Marksman with the Smart Choke concentrates the Piranha's spread to the point where all of the pellets will remain tightly grouped even at very long ranges.
Like all conventional shotguns, the Piranha suffers very little damage loss from shield gates and so is very effective against shielded infantry; however, it will deal very little damage to armored targets like Brutes especially on higher difficulties unless mods like the Shotgun High-Velocity Barrel or the Shotgun Shredder Mod are equipped, certain ammo powers/ammo bonuses are used, or enemy armor is weakened by powers such as Warp or Cryo Blast.
Single-player
For Soldier and Vanguard player classes, Incendiary Ammo's rank 6 Explosive Burst evolution effect is very effective with the Piranha, as each individual pellet has a chance to trigger the effect, and the Piranha has one of the fastest rates of fire of any shotgun.
Multiplayer
The Piranha's effectiveness with the Marksman power can make it a good option for the Quarian Marksman Soldier or the Turian Soldier; the latter can benefit from the stability bonuses available to the turian classes. High level Armor-Piercing Rounds allow for rapid takedowns of hard targets and eliminates the need for using a piercing mod.

Description[]
An assault shotgun capable of automatic fire, the Piranha is devastating at short-range but loses accuracy with distance. In the Milky Way, the Piranha was a "proof of concept" prototype by the Bradford Engineering Group. The Initiative procured their Piranhas when the company's military clients deferred on a full production run.

Features[]
The Piranha got multiple damage tweaks per pellet in addition to its overall damage during post-launch patching. Other improvements are to max ammo and force impact by its projectiles.
