Earth Systems Alliance Space is a region of the Milky Way galaxy bordered by Inner Council Space and the Attican Traverse. The name of the region is somewhat of a misnomer: While it includes Earth and much of the territory under the control of the human Systems Alliance, not all human colonies are located in this region. Moreover, it also envelops the heart of batarian space, including the batarian homeworld of Khar'shan.
Earth has increased its holdings more than tenfold since the discovery of the Charon Relay linked humanity to the rest of the galaxy. Humanity's aggressive expansionism has triggered conflicts with several neighboring species and their governments, most notably the Batarian Hegemony. Despite this, the Systems Alliance shows no signs of slowing its growth.
