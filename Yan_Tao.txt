Description[]
Even by volus standards, the pressure on Yan Tao is crushing. With an atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide, argon, and small traces of oxygen, the surface is devoid of life. However, tiny, fossilized sea creatures have been discovered in the deepest crevices of what used to be Yan Tao's oceans.
