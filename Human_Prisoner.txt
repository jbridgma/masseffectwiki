Human Prisoners are people incarcerated on Purgatory. Following Subject Zero's destructive escape from her cryo cell, several prisoners also break out of their cells and manage to procure weapons. They are hostile to their Blue Suns jailers and Commander Shepard.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Prisoners are armed with an M-3 Predator Heavy Pistol.

Defensive
Prisoners have no armor, shields, or barriers on lower difficulties. On Insanity difficulty, Prisoners' defenses are bolstered with shields.

Tactics[]
Since, for the most part, prisoners only have health, they are ideal targets for pistols, biotic powers, and health-affecting tech powers, such as Mordin's Cryo Blast.
