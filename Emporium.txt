The Emporium is an exclusive store in the Financial District on the Citadel Presidium. Its only shopkeeper is Delan, a hanar who sells armor and upgrades. A set of stairs at the back of the Emporium leads to a storeroom with an odd computer terminal to the right, and a keeper doing maintenance work to the left.
