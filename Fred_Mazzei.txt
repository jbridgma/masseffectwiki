Mass Effect 2[]
Fred Mazzei, though his client calls him "Freddy" and news broadcasts "Frederick", appears on the Citadel as the criminal Elias Kelham's advocate. During Kelham's "interview" by Shepard and Thane Krios, he may burst in the C-Sec interrogation room demanding that his client be released if the interview is taking too much time. When Shepard reveals to be a Spectre or ex-Spectre, Fred admits to Kelham that there's nothing he can do against Spectre jurisdiction, and Kelham provides the information Shepard needed if he hadn't already. Depending on the way the interview went, news broadcasts may say that Mazzei insists his client was not charged with any crime, or that he intends to file a lawsuit.
In the Shadow Broker's video archive, several recordings show "Fred Mazzei" on the Citadel: accosting a hanar on the Presidium, talking to himself in a mirror, and approaching a skycar with a salarian who gets shot as Mazzei raises his hands up while the attacker flies away.

Mass Effect (Cut)[]
A man named Fred Mazzei appears to be a major character in Caleston's cut plotlines for the first game, whose events occurred 2 years earlier.
Before Caleston, Fred Mazzei used to work in another Eldfell-Ashland Energy facility out in a neutron star's asteroid belt, but asked to be transferred because he didn't like the anti-radiation suits. By the time Shepard meets him, Fred claims he's been "digging rocks for twenty years" and has spent most of his life on starships or space stations, mentioning it took him a few weeks to get used to Caleston's ground and gravity.
Shepard meets him along with Sessa Tarrent when entering the Throw Down refinery. He may be assisted in completing the task Sessa has given him: extorting money from the town doctor Oronath.[1] Sessa also tasks both him and Shepard to destroy a drug cache belonging to the rival faction the Cartel in a tunnel. Before the job is completed, the player may have the opportunity to help Fred make up his mind about his prospects, which will eventually result in his running away during the job, or standing his ground to "impress Sessa."[2] Back at the refinery, if he hasn't deserted, it is possible to persuade Sessa to give her job as refinery overseer to Fred since she dislikes doing it, which should durably motivate him to stay on Caleston.[3]
If Fred has convinced himself to leave the planet, he can be found hiding on Throw Down, and discreetly asks Shepard for 1,000 credits to get off-world. He repeatedly pesters Shepard about it until he gets them or is told a definite "no", to which he responds he'll find a way eventually, "hiding in a shipping container maybe."[4]

Mass Effect 2 (Cut)[]

Both Elias Kelham and Fred Mazzei are named and appear in the file on which the pre-rendered cutscene showing Donovan Hock's party in the beginning of the Kasumi - Stolen Memory DLC is based. While Kelham is barely visible in the final pre-rendered cutscene, Mazzei however is shown clearly. Neither of them appear at the party itself as experienced by the player.[5]
