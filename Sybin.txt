Description[]
A small rock and ice planet, Sybin has an extremely thin atmosphere of hydrogen sulfide and ethane. Its frozen surface is mainly composed of magnesium and silicates with deposits of iron.
Sybin's crust contains significant deposits of green serpentine, a mineral formed by volcanic activity. This suggests Sybin was a more geologically active world in the distant past.

Survey Text[]
