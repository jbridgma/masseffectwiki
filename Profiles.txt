Profiles are specialized sets of improvements and passive abilities available to the Pathfinder in Mass Effect: Andromeda. Each profile improves on several aspects of a character's chosen abilities, and also provide one or two unique passive abilities to complement their skills in combat.

Overview[]
Profiles are unlocked by spending Skill Points on skills in any of the three main skillsets: Combat, Tech, and Biotics. Once sufficient points are spent in a skillset, a new Profile will be unlocked.

Note: Profiles and corresponding trainings only involve the same skill types and are similar in nature. There is no benefit or detriment to having a profile and a corresponding training. 
Each unlocked profile can achieve six ranks, each improving the stat bonuses of that profile by a set amount. Each rank requires a specific amount of skill points placed into its respective skillsets.
Unlike Classes in prior Mass Effect games, switching between available profiles is available at any time, including while in combat.

Bugs[]
Although it may be a temporary bug and/or glitch at the moment, it seems that whichever Training that was picked at the beginning of the game will let Pathfinder Ryder use its respective profile at Rank 1 for the rest of the game; this is regardless of how many points are spent to unlock it. This means that if Ryder had picked the security training, but then spent all his/her perk points into biotics, he/she would have access to both the adept and the soldier profiles.
