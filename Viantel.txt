Description[]
Though a dwarf planet, Viantel's large amounts of water have led to heavy development by water-cracking industries seeking to turn the planet into hydrogen-oxygen fuel for starship thrusters. The surface is blanketed with habitation modules, mining equipment, and cracking stations.
Since the initial settlement of Illium in the nearby Tasale system, the radius of Viantel has decreased by two kilometers, indicating removal of over 72,000 cubic kilometers of ice. Some groups are concerned that the rate of loss may cause instability in the remaining structure.

Trivia[]
A two kilometer surface layer of a globe with a radius of 1,381 kilometers actually has a volume of nearly 50,000,000 cubic kilometers — approximately 700 times the figure given.
