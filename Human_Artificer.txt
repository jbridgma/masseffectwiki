Construct specialist who debuffs enemy troops.
Back in the Milky Way, the Artificer was a high school computer science teacher; her students loved her, but knew not to cross her. In the evenings, she trained students at the same kenpo dojo where she received her 4th-degree black belt. She's the embodiment of tough love. Nothing fazes her. Not even aliens with guns.
The Human Artificer joins the Nexus militia forces during the signs of life APEX missions in Heleus Cluster.

The Human Artificer is like a much more mobile version of the Human Engineer, with up to two drones that follow her around and deal damage when they have to.
