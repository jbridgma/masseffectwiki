Locations
2175 Aeia


Feral Hunters are encountered on 2175 Aeia during Jacob's loyalty mission. They are the shipwrecked male crew-members of the MSV Hugo Gernsback who have suffered neural decay from eating the native vegetation.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Feral Hunters are armed with various assault rifles, shotguns, and SMGs. They lack any powers, whether offensive or defensive.
Defensive
Hunters have moderate health, and some shielding on higher difficulties.

Tactics[]
Feral Hunters are basic grunts, but they are still dangerous when attacking en masse. The ones armed with shotguns will try and advance on your position, so make them a priority. The ones armed with M-9 Tempest SMGs can deal very high damage as they shoot with perfect accuracy, and the long bursts can melt your shields with frightening speed and keep you pinned down.
Because they don't have any powers, they tend to stay in cover and only pop out when they start shooting at others.
Staying in cover and using accurate weapon fire are good tactics against them.
