Dorian is a cut character in Mass Effect during the deleted assignment Global Plot 1. He is Lucan's brother, helping protect other Voids in a hidden camp on Feros.
After Lucan escaped from Lysander Kostas' MindTech office on Noveria with other Voids, he met with his brother Dorian, who would hire Horace and other mercenaries to keep them safe and hidden. Due to this, Dorian came to wrongfully believe that Lysander was responsible for his brother's state. At some point however, Lucan had to leave the camp as he was threatening the safety of the group. Dorian came to regret letting him leave alone.
After finding the camp, Shepard's squadmates let it slip that they've met Lucan, which prompts an immediate reaction of Dorian asking where he is. Depending on Shepard's tone, Dorian may react with sorrow or anger at hearing the news that Lucan is dead. Dorian later hands over Lucan's datapad to Shepard to help locate the MindTech office, urging Shepard kill Lysander for what he did to Lucan. Shortly after, the camp is attacked by unknown assailants, which Dorian assumes are Lysander's men. If Dorian survives the assault, he and Horace start making preparations to move the group to a new location.[1]
