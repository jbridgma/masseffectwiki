General Notes[]
The Asari Adept is a true Combo Queen, able to leverage Annihilation with Throw and Lance to create biotic combo explosions all over the battlefield.
Throw is the more useful detonator, as it is homing. However, even Rank 1 Lance can detonate, so don't forget Lance if Throw is on cooldown.
Annihilation's Rank 5 Biotic Wind is a good choice here, as it lets the Adept engage in Annihilation range faster. Upgrading the field's range and having it help recover shields are also very useful for this class.
