Description[]
Zakros is a terrestrial world with a nitrogen-methane atmosphere containing trace amounts of hydrocarbons. Its frigid surface is mainly composed of water ice and hydrocarbon slush. Most of the surface is not solid enough to support the full weight of a landed ship. If approach is necessary, use shuttles or keep the ship's mass effect envelope up.

Trivia[]
Zakros was a major Minoan city, one of the Minoan civilization's four main administrative hubs, as well as a major center for both military and civilian shipping.
