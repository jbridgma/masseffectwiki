Description[]
Aventen is named for a tactician-philosopher whose treatise on leadership is known by every turian youth who pays attention in class. It is a small, hot rock planet surrounded by a haze of methane and helium. It was thoroughly mined for valuable minerals in the early days of the turian space age, and since then has had little to offer. Aventen's token spy satellites and defense drones proved no match for even a small Reaper presence, and best reports suggest they have been eliminated.
