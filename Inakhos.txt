Description[]
Inakhos is a metallic asteroid. The surface was once raided for its abundant olivine, which is used for carbon sequestration on heavily populated worlds. More than half the mass of the asteroid has now been depleted, exposing its relatively pure iron-nickel core.

Trivia[]
Unlike most other known celestial objects in the Mesopotamian-themed Ninmah Cluster, Inakhos appears to be named after a Greek river god with numerous offspring.
