Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Biotic explosions from units primed by Singularity do not end the skill effect. It will continue to ensare unshielded enemies until its duration elapses.
As with Annihilation, audio is slightly distorted within Singularity's area of effect. Positioning within doesn't damage player characters or constructs.
While a target must have no Armor or Shields in order to be lifted, all targets in Singularity’s area of effect are Primed, even if they have protection. However, protected enemies are still able to move, allowing them to move out of the area of effect.
Strategies
As with its incarnations in the original trilogy, this skill is a crowd control ability against masses of unshielded and unarmored units.
Ensaring shielded units typically means stripping the shields first in conjunction with one of the player character's other powers or manually shredding them with weapons. Singularity's native damage per second can do the job if the enemy's shield bar is low to begin with, but it needs evolving into Rank 5 Anti-Shield when dealing with tougher shields.
While the skill has negligible effects on armored units, Rank 6 Exploding Singularity can put a significant dent on their armor bars.
On multiplayer, laying a Singularity on top of one's position while disarming devices or retrieving them lessens the risk of being ambushed by flankers like Adhi while performing the task.
Singularity’s ability to Prime protected units means that it is an effective tool for stripping Shields, even without the Anti-Shield evolution, as you can drop a Singularity on them, then immediately use a detonator to trigger a Biotic Combo. Biotic Combos are less effective against Armor, so this is not as effective against armored units, but shielded units can have their shields stripped very quickly using this method.
