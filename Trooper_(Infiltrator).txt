Troopers are basic Cerberus soldiers on the Barn space station. They are fought by Randall Ezno during his escape.

Tactics[]
Troopers possess a moderate layer of shielding on top of their health, which will regenerate over time.
Troopers will often take cover during the firefight, and tend not to come out unless you're in their line of fire. This allows you to wait out behind cover for your powers to recharge without being disturbed. If necessary, using Pull will flush them from cover into the open.
Like other humanoid enemies in the game, these soldiers are vulnerable to headshots, receiving bonus damage when shot there.
