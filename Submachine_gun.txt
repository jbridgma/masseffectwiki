Submachine Guns (SMGs) are one of the primary weapons in the Mass Effect universe. They are a class of rapid-firing weapons, with both fully-automatic and burst-fire models. SMGs generally have low accuracy and damage per shot, offset by their thermal clip size and rate of fire. They are best suited for close- to mid-range combat.

Mass Effect 2[]
SMGs possess a bonus to damage against shields and biotic barriers, but are weak against armor.  Like all other non-heavy weapon types in Mass Effect 2 with the exception of sniper rifles, SMGs benefit from increasing damage against targets at close ranges, maximized at point-blank (melee) range.
All player classes except soldiers start the game able to use SMGs. The following squadmates also utilize submachine guns: Miranda, Mordin, Samara/Morinth, Thane, Kasumi, Liara, and Dr. Amanda Kenson.

Mass Effect 3[]
Submachine guns lack the diversity of the other weapon types, with all models firing standard rounds at a high rate of fire, with any particular model usually being a tradeoff between either damage or accuracy/stability. In general, SMGs are the least damaging weapon type, though some models can rival assault rifles in destructive power. 
Accuracy can be improved by aiming down sights, firing from cover, or by equipping a scope, though the latter is often not a practical option owing to the muzzle climb of many SMG models, which can be somewhat mitigated by firing from cover or equipping a stability-enhancing mod.
SMGs are a light weapon type even when unmodified, and if equipped with an Ultralight Materials mod their weight can be reduced to negligible amounts. This makes them attractive choices for more power-oriented classes, along with heavy pistols; both weapon types can potentially be equipped with Power Magnifier mods for even more enhancement of the wielder's abilities. Also, a high-level SMG High-Velocity Barrel can make any SMG effective against armored targets while remaining economical in weight; the Collector SMG and the Blood Pack Punisher are heavier models, but they both deal bonus damage to armor.
Unlike heavy pistols, SMGs cannot be modified to improve the user's melee damage, though having an SMG as the active weapon does allow for faster melee attacks than with shotguns, sniper rifles, or assault rifles.
Any class can benefit from a light SMG as a backup weapon for enhancing powers or handling tasks like shooting through obstacles, destroying weak but numerous enemies, or juggling ammo power assignments within the party in single-player. 
The following squadmates utilize submachine guns: EDI, Liara, Aria, Kasumi, Miranda, and Samara.
