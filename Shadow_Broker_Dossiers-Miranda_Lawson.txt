13:45 OR: Hey. Umm...is that you?
13:45 ML: Yes. Don't worry, I've made sure everything is secure.
13:46 OR: Secure. Right. Yeah, good call.
13:46 ML: How are you settling in?
13:46 OR: Good! The house is huge! Seems so big for me.
13:47 ML: How are your studies going?
13:47 OR: Great! I still don't like Genetic Theory, but I want to understand everything y'know? Physics and Math all seem to breeze by.
13:48 ML: Your mark in Late 20th Century Earth History is below the standard deviation. Did you want me to hire a tutor for you?
13:48 OR: History? No, it's OK. Just not interested I guess.
13:49 ML: Ori.
13:50 OR: What? Fiiiine...yes. OK, there's a boy in there. Danner.
13:51 ML: Danner Gossimah?
13:51 OR: Yes! How did you know that?
13:52 ML: It doesn't matter. His family owns a series of restaurants on the Citadel. Good academic record. Interested in sports. Broke his leg when he was 14.
13:53 OR: Umm... sure. Yes, he's always asking questions in class. I don't think he even knows I'm alive.
13:54 ML: I see.
13:55 OR: How do I...y'know, get him to notice?
13:55 ML: Getting him to notice? Yes, I can help with that.
13:55 OR: Pleez
13:58 ML: Yes. Boys. You must be sure to always be true to yourself. I know that sounds like silly advice but if he isn't interested in the real you he won't be interested. You have to trust that when things are right he will notice you, and he will appreciate what you are both inside and out. You can't make yourself into something you are not
13:58 OR: because you will never learn if that special someone falls for you or falls for a lie.
13:58 ML: Ori I didn't
13:58 OR: You are pasting advice from 'Dear Dinah' column dated two weeks ago! We have the extranet here as well sis. God!
13:59 ML: I didn't mean to make you angry. I only
13:59 OR: I know sis! I know... I'm sorry, I just hate all this. Being here and you're off doing whatever to save the world or whatever. I just hate it!
14:03 ML: There isn't a point to saving the world if I can't even talk to my sister. I'm sorry. I am. Now why don't you tell me about this boy.
14:04 OR: Yeah, OK. He's...different.
14:04 ML: I hate him already.
14:04 OR: RANDA!
14:05 ML: I'm your big sister. I'm going to hate all of them. Accept it. Now, his eye color says blue here. Is that ocean blue or a more gun metal blue?
