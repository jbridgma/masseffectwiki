The Varren Alpha is the leader in a pack of varren. It is encountered during the assignment Feros: Varren Meat.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




One of the colonists informs Shepard that the food supply of Zhu's Hope is running low. If Shepard goes to investigate, a bunch of varren will confront the crew. After killing all the varren, the alpha male makes its appearance.

Tactics[]
Because the Varren Alpha is tougher than the average varren, it will charge faster and hit harder. It can kill in just a few hits with its massive bite, so keep moving and use your squad members to aid you.
Kinetic biotics like Singularity, Lift and Throw are helpful in dealing with the Varren Alpha.
Neural Shock is good to knock the varren down for a few seconds.
