Description[]
Rescel is a massive "hot Jupiter" gas giant that whips around the star Satent once every four and a half days. Like most planets of its type, it migrated inwards from its initial position in the system (thought to be around 0.3 AU).
Rescel is one of the few close-orbiting gas giants to show a marked temperature difference in its sun-facing and dark-side hemispheres. The atmosphere absorbs and re-radiates Satent's heat too quickly for winds to carry the heat to the dark side. There is a temperature difference of over 1,000 degrees between the gas giant's "hot" and "cold" poles.
