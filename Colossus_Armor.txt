Colossus Armor is manufactured by Kassa Fabrication and comes in human, turian, krogan, and quarian models. Shepard can procure the armory license for Kassa Fabrication from either the C-Sec Requisitions Officer or Petozi, the elcor merchant on Noveria's Peak 15.
Colossus Armor has both the highest protection against non-tech/biotic damage and shield efficiency of all armors, thanks to the micro-generators it incorporates.[1] It is considered one of the top two armors attainable without console commands, the other being Predator L/M/H Armor. Colossus Armor has lower shields and tech/biotic resistance than Predator L/M/H Armor, but higher damage protection. It has distinctive red and black coloring.
Levels VII through X can be obtained through normal means; lower levels can be obtained upon completion of X57: Bring Down the Sky.
