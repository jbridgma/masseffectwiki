Prometheus Station is part of a series of Cerberus research facilities on the planet Aite devoted to Project Overlord.







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




The station is actually a crashed geth ship full of dormant geth units, which are used by the Project Overlord research team in their experiments.
During the mission to breach Atlas Station, Commander Shepard is told by Dr. Gavin Archer that the overrides at Prometheus Station and Vulcan Station need to be overridden before Shepard can access Atlas Station.
The VI that was being experimented on, took control of the ship's cannon, and attempted to stop Shepard from entering in the Hammerhead. After Shepard and the squad breached the station and overrode the local lockdown control, the VI fought back by activating the geth and resulted in Shepard and the squad fighting their way out of the station.

Trivia[]
Prometheus Station is likely named in reference to the Titan Prometheus from Greek mythology. Prometheus aided early man by stealing fire from the gods and giving it to man. When his actions were discovered, Prometheus was punished harshly.
On Prometheus Station, an audio recording proves humanity still celebrates Halloween. "Yesterday was Halloween. Lanigan ran around wearing spare geth parts. Spooked the shit out of everyone. Now I definitely hate him."
