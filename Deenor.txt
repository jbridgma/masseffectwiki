Deenor is one of the scientists working on Hjara Station's ice samples. Compared to his colleague Janleth, he is more willing to conceptualize alternative theories as opposed to more mundane explanations. They were both university-educated in Voeld's capital Estraaja.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




When Deenor and Janleth were students, one of their classmates claimed hearing voices through the ice at an old archaeological dig. Two months later, another group claimed they heard the same thing, only angrier. They dubbed the phenomenon "ice talkers" and became something of a joke from their batch, although Deenor's sister continued to believe it was real.
Years later, Deenor becomes convinced he discovered something peculiar about the ice sample he and Janleth were studying. The microbe variety in the top layer is different and contains traces of four different radioactive isotopes, possibly suggesting Scourge handiwork, or less seriously, "ice talkers." Deenor ran some calculations and he believes the numbers check out, but Janleth thinks he's trying to fit data to his conclusions, so Deenor suggests they should get a larger sample and keep digging.
