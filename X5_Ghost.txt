Description[]
Andromeda Initiative engineers developed the automatic X5 Ghost from the baseline M-8 Avenger to make it easier to maintain and modify aboard the arks and the Nexus. The standard rifle for Initiative personnel also possesses recording and sensor functions so it can be left behind as a "black box" by doomed explorers.

Features[]
Despite being classified as Rare weapon, the X5 Ghost only has 2 augmentation slots. It was also unable to be dismantled, though in subsequent patches that's no longer the case.
The X5 Ghost has negative recoil, meaning that as the trigger is held down, the weapon's accuracy gradually increases instead of decreases. It reaches its highest accuracy after continually firing for 2 seconds.
The multiplayer Ghost received multiple improvements to damage in updates. Its reload time also decreased from 2.1 seconds to 1.6-1.5 seconds depending on rank.

Trivia[]
Similar to the M-8 Avenger in the first three games, the X5 Ghost functions as the default cutscene weapon regardless of what the characters were actually holding at the time.
Despite being described as standard issue for Initiative personnel, this weapon is only seen in use by Pathfinder Ryder and squadmates during cutscenes.
