Player Notes[]
Mechanics
An Assault Turret floats a few inches off the ground and, when budged, typically does not stray far from its position. However, extreme physics-based assaults like Adhi bites can dislodge the turret and cause it to settle a few meters away.
Rank 6 Cryo Ammo and Flamethrower inflicts status effects by chance. The enemy must be visibly freezing or burning before any follow-up with a combo detonator.
Detonating a turret only harms hostiles.
Strategies
The turret, as with Remnant VI, is a good decoy for drawing enemy fire while its creator deals damage elsewhere. Being a static emplacement by nature, however, it is vulnerable to thrown grenades and swarming mobs of enemies.
Since the turret can prime detonations at rank 6, and most classes using them have innate detonator powers, incendiary/cryo/disruptor boosters can be disregarded in lieu of boosters in other stats.
Rank 5 Omni-Link allows the player to deal skill damage more frequently than Rank 5 Damage. While the turret is powerful in its own right, the player participation will expedite the cleansing of enemies from any given location.
The typical setup with this is that the turret creator is hunkered down behind cover while the turret is somewhere nearby but conspicuous to the enemy. On multiplayer, this makes Hack and Upload objectives more easier to defend and accomplish.
Rank 6 Flamethrower paired with Omni-Link creates a turret that can hold off flanking units' assaults and also synergizes well with any detonator powers the player has.
While all turrets are disposable, an alternative build is to spec a turret into a non-regenerating but more powerful gun. This allows its creator to be more mobile by virtue of not being required to stand/crouch nearby for the bonuses.
