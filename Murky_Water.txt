Description[]
Despite the name, Murky Water has yet to show any signs of having water whatsoever. Its name is a literal translation from the original hanar, who consider murky water a sign of danger. Murky Water has a hazy, crushing atmosphere of carbon dioxide and methane which brings the surface heat to boiling levels. It remains unexploited, its gravity and temperature too high to bother.
