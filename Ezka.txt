Description[]
According to batarian propaganda, the batarian population exceeds the Council races, the batarian military is the most powerful, and the batarians' unlivable hothouse planets are the hottest and most unlivable. Their best proof of this last point is Ezka, which closely orbits the scorching yellow-white star Untrel. Ezka's nitrogen-heavy atmosphere might once have held oxygen, but if so, it burned off long ago. Even robo-miners don't care for Ezka--although some modern mining equipment can withstand the heat, the machinery still gets stuck in the soup of molten light metals on the planet's surface.
Reaper presence near Ezka seems light. Scans reveal wreckage orbiting the planet, likely destroyed Hegemony surveillance drones.
