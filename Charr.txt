Charr is a krogan transport technician on Illium. Unusually for a krogan, he is not a brute, but rather a sensitive "lover-boy" type.

Mass Effect 2[]
Charr is in a relationship with Ereba, an asari merchant in the transport hub. Unfortunately, their relationship has hit a rocky patch, as Ereba is hesitant to settle down with him permanently and wonders if he is only interested in her in order to reproduce. As a consequence, Charr stands nearby Ereba reciting love poetry, in the hope that he will regain her affections.
He brings Ereba to Tuchanka if she was convinced by Commander Shepard to rekindle their relationship. Ereba expresses her doubts and hesitation at the ramshackle state of Tuchanka and the xenophobic attitudes of the other krogan. She then desires to leave. Charr is able to convince Ereba to stay by saying that the dilapidated appearance of Tuchanka builds character and that she doesn't have to worry about the other krogan as she is under Charr's protection.

Mass Effect 3[]

Charr joined up with scouts who were then deployed to Utukku to investigate the rumored presence of rachni. Unfortunately his entire unit was wiped out by the creatures, and his body ended up deep within the caves.
Should Shepard follow up on what happened to the scouts, Charr's body can be discovered behind some webbing, amidst clusters of mutated rachni eggs. He left a passionate voice-recording final message for Ereba. Shepard can retrieve it and deliver it to Ereba on the Citadel. If Ereba was convinced to rekindle her relationship with Charr in 2185, the message will also contain a poetic reference to their unborn child.
