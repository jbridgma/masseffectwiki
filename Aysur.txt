Aysur has above-average amounts of mineral resources. Its gas giants have moderate amounts of metals while its terrestrial worlds have rich concentrations. 
Most of the mining interests in the area are involved in Arvuna's economy. Despite its potential wealth, the system itself is considered politically insignificant to the Systems Alliance, the Attican Traverse, and even the Terminus Systems.
