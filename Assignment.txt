Assignments are the side missions of Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2. These have little to no bearing to the overarching narrative, but completing them may further understanding of the series' underlying workings.
There is a large variety of assignments to complete; this page is a list of them. Click on a specific assignment in the list to read its detailed walkthrough. For a list of missions broken up by cluster and system, see the Mass Effect System Guide.

Some assignments are listed more than once; this is intentional and is intended to make them simpler to find by listing them in all relevant contexts as they appear in the Journal.
For an alphabetical list of assignments, see Category:Assignments; for locations, see Category:Assignment Locations.
