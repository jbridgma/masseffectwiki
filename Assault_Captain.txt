The Assault Captain is a Cerberus officer who lead a squad of Assault Troopers into battle. Randall Ezno encounters him on the Barn space station during his escape.

Tactics[]
The Assault Captain has considerable health and a strong layer of shielding. The shield regenerates over time.
The Assault Captain often takes cover during the firefight and tends not to come out unless you're in his line of sight. This allows you to wait out behind cover for your powers to recharge without being disturbed. If necessary, using Pull will flush them out of cover.
Like other humanoid enemies in the game, the Assault Captain is vulnerable to headshots, which inflict bonus damage on him.
Like regular assault troopers, the Assault Captain possesses jetpacks, allowing him to quickly get within the effective range of their Eviscerator shotguns. While he is in flight, using Pull can interrupt him.
Trivia[]
This enemy is only encountered once in the game and is similar in appearance to the Trooper and Assault Trooper.
