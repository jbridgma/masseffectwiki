Appearances
Mass Effect: Andromeda


Cassandra Verner is a sister of Conrad Verner. She works as a Tartarus nightclub dancer in Kadara Slums.
Cassandra claims she left the Milky Way to get away from her "crazy family." She disparages her brother's stalkerish tendencies with Commander Shepard, when it turns out she herself obsessively idolizes Kadara Port's leader Sloane Kelly. Cassandra even imitates Sloane's hairstyle, and she harbors aspirations of working for her someday in order to become "just like her." If she achieves her goals, she wants to contact Conrad (apparently regardless of the feasibility of such an act) and prove to him he's not the only one in the family hanging out with famous people.
Pathfinder Ryder can see her lounging on a sofa while she's on her break, and Cassandra assumes they're looking to get her for a dance. She doesn't mind living in the slums, and in fact considers her life in Andromeda great compared to her life in the Milky Way.

Trivia[]
Cassandra sports slightly different facial features and a paler complexion in earlier versions of the game.
