Cipritine Armory is a shop located on the Presidium Commons in the Citadel. The kiosk is on the upper level of the Meridian Place Market, right next to Aegohr Munitions. 
The shop touts professional-grade equipment at reasonable prices, and they come with a lifetime performance guarantee. It sets aside a portion of its sales to support the turians' war effort on Palaven.






“There won't be an Earth left to save...” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 3 follow.




One of its salarian merchants, Kannik, has been withholding his high-end inventory from C-Sec, on the grounds that tangible goods will become more valuable than credits whatever the outcome of the war. He has them stashed among associates, who won't release the weapons without his okay in case something happens to him. Commander Shepard can trade black market artifacts of comparable value in exchange for Kannik releasing his inventory to C-Sec.

Trivia[]
Cipritine is the capital city of Palaven.
