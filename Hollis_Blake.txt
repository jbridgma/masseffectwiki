Hollis Blake is one of the human colonists at Zhu's Hope, on Feros. Hollis became the medic for Zhu's Hope after their doctor was killed. 







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Hollis is found inside the Borealis, tending to his wife Calantha. If Commander Shepard asks what is wrong, or offers to help, Hollis insists that Calantha just needs rest and asks Shepard to leave her in peace.
Hollis is, like the other colonists at Zhu's Hope, infected with Thorian spores. Along with Calantha — who was apparently adjusting to the infection — he defends Zhu's Hope against Shepard and the team when they return from the ExoGeni building. He teams up with Arcelia Silva Martinez and some other colonists in trying to ambush Shepard's squad at the colony entrance barricades.
If he survived past the Thorian's destruction, he thanks Shepard for giving him his mind back. He recounts his experiences being enthralled, claiming even thinking about defiance is painful. Eventually they just instinctively did what the creature wanted.
If the colony survived, Hollis is confident Zhu's Hope can thrive as long as they're motivated to work on it. Otherwise, if too many died he thinks the colony has nothing left but bad memories. If Shepard is a colonist, Hollis mentions they went through something similar to his current experience, musing it's always a shame to see a colony fail. He's had enough and he wants to find other ways to make a living.

Trivia[]
Hollis Blake is voiced by Bill Ratner, who also voices Donnel Udina.
