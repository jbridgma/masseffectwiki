This article is about the manufacturer. For the location in Mass Effect 3: Citadel, see Armax Arsenal Arena.


The main supplier of elite turian military units, Armax Arsenal weapons and armor are high quality, high priced and very difficult to acquire for most non-turians. They also make a basic grade omni-tool which is available to the general public. Armax Arsenal produces Predator L/M/H Armor.
In Mass Effect, a licence for Armax Arsenal gear can be purchased from Expat at the Citadel for a cost of 30,000 credits. 
Armax Arsenal also runs a popular simulated combat arena on the Citadel that broadcasts matches across the galaxy.

Mass Effect 2[]
In Mass Effect 2, Armax Arsenal manufactures one heavy weapon:

ML-77 Missile Launcher
Rapid-fire missile launcher with seeking projectiles. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers.
Missile launchers are surfacing with increasing frequency among the Terminus Systems mercernary bands, but their origin is unknown. Each projectile features a friend-or-foe recognition system, ensuring it will find a hostile target - though not necessarily the one in the crosshairs. In urban situations, it is useful for taking out snipers and other entrenched enemies, so it is popular with the Blue Suns mercenary band. It is nearly impossible to duplicate, as it uses Fabrication Rights Management (FRM) technology.
Armor[]
Mass Effect[]
Thanks to woven armalite, all lines of Armax Arsenal armors have outstanding shield performance and higher resistance to tech and biotic damage when compared to most competitors.[2]

Mass Effect 2[]
Main article: Armor Customization
In Mass Effect 2, Armax Arsenal manufactures three pieces for the N7 armor:


Capacitor ChestplateMicro wells developed by Armax Arsenal store part of the energy directed at the armor and use it to jump start the kinetic barrier recharge cycle.




Shield HarnessA series of ultra-efficient storage cells designed by Armax Arsenal to augment the existing power in the operation of the wearer's kinetic barrier.




Heavy Damping GauntletsArmax Arsenal added micro-harmonic oscillators to reduce stress on the kinetic barriers ensuring suit integrity when faced with oncoming projectiles.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 48: Armax Arsenal's Phasic Chambering gives +30% to Damage, +10% to Heat Absorption and +45% to Accuracy. When compared to baseline stats, increases are clearly visible for all three, but only the Damage percentage appears precisely correct.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 48: Armax Arsenal's Woven Armalite gives +80% to Shields (highest reported in the guide) and +20% to Hardening. The calculations for Shields appear correct, but not for Hardening, despite a clear increase being visible when compared to baseline stats.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 48: Armax Arsenal's Neural Sequencer reportedly gives +15% to Duration and -15% to Power; however the correct numbers appear to be "-15" on both counts in comparison to baseline stats.
