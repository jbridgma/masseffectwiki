Player Notes[]
Grenade powers do not have a recharge time and, thus, can be used immediately at any time, provided grenades are available. Using the power consumes one grenade each time.
If the player has multiple grenade powers, the grenade pool is shared between them.
Damage values are added on top of the regular damage done by the omni-bow.
Only one arrow power can be active at a time.
The Rank 5 Shock evolution can prime targets hit for Tech Bursts.
The amount of force delivered by a concentrated volley of Concussive Arrows can be extreme. It is even capable of knocking infantry enemies still with active shields or barriers such as Marauders off their feet and sending them flying. This can be used to blast enemies off the map for environmental kills.
