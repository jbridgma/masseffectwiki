Bartenders are employees that work for Fist at Chora's Den. They are encountered in the Citadel: Expose Saren mission.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Along with the Krogan Bouncer and the Thugs that Fist has hired, the Bartenders will attempt to defend Chora's Den during Shepard's all-out assault.

Tactics[]
Bartenders have similar defenses to the Thugs that Fist hired in terms of shields and health. They will try and stay in cover as much as possible to avoid taking any real damage, and only pop out to take potshots at opponents. Alone, they are relatively easy to take out, but the close quarters of Chora's Den and the numbers of enemies ensconced within make using cover essential. The deadly crossfire these enemies produce can easily overwhelm an incautious player.
