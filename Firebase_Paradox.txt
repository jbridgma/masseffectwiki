Firebase Paradox is a map in Mass Effect: Andromeda's multiplayer mode.
Description[]
The kett uncovered an invaluable and mysterious Remnant artifact on this uncharted world. Its power could allow them -or anyone who controls it- to dominate this system. With such high stakes, even the kett's defense can't keep intruders out, or contain the Remnant. Battles erupt on the various research platforms on the artifact as the militia fights against any enemy footholds.
