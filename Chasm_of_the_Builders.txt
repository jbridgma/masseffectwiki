The Chasm of the Builders is a Remnant geological feature that separates Pelaav Research Station and surrounding territories from Havarl's easternmost monolith. 
There is only one bridge that allows passage to the other side, though the Roekaar control it. The generator powering it on the western side is initially inoperable.
The waterlogged bottom of the chasm is teeming with both organic and synthetic activity. Assemblers and Observers generally patrol about, as well as other wildlife endemic to the world. The western side of the chasm has two locations that allow jumpjet-assisted access to the bottom; the northern location has a site for a Forward Station.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




At the southern end of the chasm lies the entrance to Mithrava Ascent. At the northern end is an entry point to the Buried Cave, where the world's lost third monolith lies underneath.
During the mission to reverse Havarl's ecological collapse, Roekaar soldiers repair the generator powering the bridge and thus restore the ground connection between opposing sides of the chasm.
