Space Beetles are large insectoid creatures that can be found on a few uncharted or barely settled worlds. 
These creatures possess a chitinous orange shell, have two large eyes and four feelers on their heads, and walk around on four legs. A normal specimen is comparable in size to a humanoid being, while the smaller ones which may be juveniles are about as large as a human head. The beetles are fragile can be dispatched with a single shot. Unlike other benign animals, shooting the Space Beetles does not provoke comments of disdain from Commander Shepard's squad.
Space Beetles can be found on Ontarom in 2183 and are likely being studied as part of the careful cataloging of the planet's native life. Unlike Space Cows, which can also be found on the world, the beetles cannot be talked to. A turian wreckage on the planet has a Space Beetle nest nearby, with its inhabitants barely paying any attention to the dead turians there or any other external stimuli for that matter.
Space Beetles can also be encountered on Haestrom, Zorya, and other worlds in 2185. Unlike the members of the species found on Ontarom, these Space Beetles immediately flee the area when Shepard and the squad intrude.
