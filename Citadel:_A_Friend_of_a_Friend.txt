Citadel: A Friend of a Friend is an assignment in Mass Effect which was cut during development. It would have taken place on the Citadel, and would have opposed a doctor with someone named Laz.

Plotline[]
After an introductory scene has played, Commander Shepard could talk to a "doctor", or to "Laz." The player would then be able to choose whether to take the doctor's side, or Laz's. If taking the doctor's side, Shepard would have to deal with Laz by either using Charm or Intimidate, or by paying him off, which would complete the assignment.[1]

Trivia[]
Like other deleted Citadel assignments, this side-plot bears strong resemblances to one that shipped in the final game: Citadel: Doctor Michel, which has the common theme of helping a doctor against a third party on the Citadel.
