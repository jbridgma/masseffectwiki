Description[]
A desert of whitish potassium salts and reddish iron oxides, Taitus is far enough away from its parent star to have a tolerable surface temperature. Though it has only a trace atmosphere of carbon dioxide and oxygen, it is still hospitable enough for criminals in the Terminus Systems to use it as a staging base. Turian patrols sometimes fly through the area, looking to pre-empt jailbreak attempts on Maitrum's prisons.
TRAVEL ADVISORY: Unregistered starships have been spotted in the vicinity of Taitus. Civilian travel is not recommended.

Trivia[]
Before he joined the Normandy SR-2, Zaeed Massani visited this world on a mission to destroy an Eclipse base.
Much like a select few number of celestial objects with Assignments, there is inconsistency between the object description and the actual surface: Taitus is described as having a "trace atmosphere of carbon dioxide and oxygen" but upon landing it appears to have very significant cloud cover; only possible with a dense atmosphere (suggesting a probable writing error).
