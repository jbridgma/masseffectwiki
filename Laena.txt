Description[]
Laena ("cloaked") is a methane-clouded hothouse planet. Its lack of a metal-rich core and significant magnetosphere allows for an easy scan, which reveals mining equipment on its surface. It can be deduced that this mining occurred within the last five years — any longer and the machines would have been worn to nothing by the excessive heat and dust storms of hot iron oxide.
