This article is about weapon upgrades in Mass Effect. For weapon upgrades in Mass Effect 2, see Research. For weapon upgrades in Mass Effect 3, see Weapon Mods. For upgrades generally, see Upgrades.


Weapon Upgrades are applied to assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles and pistols to augment them. Each weapon has one ammo upgrade slot and at least one weapon upgrade slot; better weapons have two weapon upgrade slots in addition to the ammo slot.

Notes:

You do not have to personally equip these upgrades to counteract radar jamming—any squad member with a scanner equipped on an active (unholstered) weapon will share the benefit.
Entering the Mako while any party member has scanner upgrades equipped on a currently drawn weapon will enable the vehicle's radar to receive the benefit of the detection upgrade.

Frictionless Materials[]
Description: Frictionless Materials give rounds more power at impact while minimizing weapon overheating. Highly recommended for shotguns. Also useful for sniper rifles.
Note: Frictionless Materials shares the same stats as Kinetic Coil, but varies where "Weapon Stability" is changed to "Heat Damping." Both used in conjunction on higher level weapons allow the user hold down the trigger without fear of losing stability, or overheating, while also dramatically increasing killing power.

Notes:

Kinetic Coil shares the same stats as Frictionless Materials, but varies where "Heat Damping" is changed to "Weapon Stability." Both used in conjunction on higher level weapons allow the user hold down the trigger without fear of losing stability, or overheating, while also dramatically increasing killing power.
Weapon stability controls the length of time it takes for a weapon's targeting circle swells to maximum size during continuous fire. More accuracy means a smaller initial targeting circle.
Cut Upgrades[]
The following weapon upgrade was cut before release and can only be acquired through PC Cheats.

Hyper Rail[]
      
Description: A hyper rail upgrade extends the barrel of the weapon and "overclocks" its mass accelerator equipment. Its hypervelocity slugs impact with enough force to be useful against lightly armored vehicles, but produce significant heat and recoil.
