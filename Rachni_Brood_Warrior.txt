Rachni Brood Warriors are rachni who are much larger and stronger than normal Rachni Soldiers. They are the 'elder males' of the hive that usually mate with the queen. According to historical information, it is said that they only attack when the hive is particularly strained for warriors. 
The Brood Warrior has abilities comparable to a standard Rachni Soldier, although its attacks inflict more damage. It is also unique among rachni in that it possesses some biotic abilities. Brood Warriors will use Warp, occasionally place a squad member in Stasis, and appear to use a form of Barrier. Their hind legs and tentacle-arms glow with biotic energy whenever they use one of their biotic abilities.

Tactics[]
Brood Warriors typically engage their targets with their long-range abilities, and will attempt to retreat if rushed at point-blank range. If backed into a corner or otherwise unable to move further, however, they will swipe their long tentacles at the enemy for massive melee damage.
Their biotics are a big problem, but you can use biotics against them as well.
Like Rachni Soldiers, when they get hit by biotics, they tend to go onto their bellies for a few seconds. This can give you some breathing room and a chance to remove a good chunk of their high health.
A few Brood Warriors are encountered while you are in the Mako. Shooting at them once with the main gun won't kill them outright, giving you ample opportunity to finish them off on foot if you're worried about vehicle experience penalty or with the machine gun if not.
Brood Warriors are usually accompanied by Rachni Soldiers – be wary of their acid spit, which goes right through the Mako's shields.
