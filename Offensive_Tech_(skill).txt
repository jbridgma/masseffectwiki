Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Offensive Tech will only work while using Tech Skills.
Strategies
Rank 6 Technical Rounds is a great way to increase weapon damage for tech skill heavy Profiles such as Engineers, Infiltrators, or Sentinels if skill points haven't been invested in the weapon skills (such as Assault Rifles).
Rank 4 Anti-Armor combines well with biotic skills that have Anti-Shield bonuses (such as Nova, Pull, and Singularity) to help rounding out damage application.
