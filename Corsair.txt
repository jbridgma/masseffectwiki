Corsairs were Alliance Marines serving under an independent starship captain to conduct autonomous missions outside of Alliance jurisdiction, giving the Alliance the ability to disavow any knowledge of them. Such operatives were often granted considerable liberty and autonomy in order to facilitate efficient operation, though it was noted that even they were subjected to bureaucracy that impeded them.

Jacob Taylor was a Corsair with the Alliance military before joining Cerberus.
