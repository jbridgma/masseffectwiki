Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Pinnacle Station: Combat Missions

You will receive this assignment after completing Ahern's special scenario on Pinnacle Station.  

Walkthrough[]
Activate the terminal that says 'Message Waiting' once inside Shepard's Apartment on Intai'sei. The message describes a convoy which has some equipment that can be purchased for a nominal fee. The equipment falls into three categories by ship: A purchase from the MSV Collins will cost 5,000 credits and result in a random tier IV upgrade, armor, or weapon, a purchase from the MSV Adams will cost 75,000 credits and result in a random tier VIII upgrade, armor, or weapon, and a purchase from the MSV Wallace will cost 220,000 credits and result in a random tier X upgrade, armor, or weapon. The assignment will be marked as complete after the first purchase, but can be repeated an infinite number of times if desired.

Often the items granted from the assignment differ greatly from their cost at other merchants, sometimes more and other times significantly less. These purchases are not dependent on character levels, and present the possible acquisition of powerful items early in the game. Repeatedly ordering items from the MSV Wallace appears to be one of the faster ways to acquire a number of rare and valuable items; the best Bio-amps and Omni-tools, the best Quarian Armor, the rather intriguing krogan Rage Armor from the Geth Armory, and perhaps most usefully of all, the entire set of Spectre - Master Gear - at a fraction of their cost from other vendors.
Also, repeatedly ordering items from the MSV Collins is a good way to build a stockpile of cheap items to convert into Omni-gel, especially later in the game when all items acquired are worth 10,000 credits or more.
To ensure that you get the items you want it may be a good idea to save before buying something then save again after the item is bought and arrives, so if you end up with an unwanted item all you have to do is load the previous save and buy another item.
