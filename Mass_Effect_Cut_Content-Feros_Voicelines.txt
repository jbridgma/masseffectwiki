(Colonist 3)

Colonist: We must stand firm or they'll overtake us.

Colonist: The geth are relentless.

Colonist: I trust Fai Dan with my life. I just hope it doesn't come to that.

Colonist: Those geth will be back.

Even if the attacks are repelled, we'll simply fade away.Colonist: Macha does what she can, but we've been without water for days.Colonist: Those geth don't even have to attack if we die of thirst.Colonist: This may become a war of attrition if we don't get some water flowing.Colonist: Even if the geth stop attacking, we'll still be in trouble. Colonist: We have a chance if the geth can be defeated.Colonist: We have water. I hope we live to make use of it.Colonist: The geth must be stopped or our colony will die.Colonist: Water ensures we will never be without.

(Colonist 4)

Colonist: You aren't one of us. You should go to Fai Dan.

Colonist: The geth have ruined our colony. They must be eradicated.

Colonist: This colony needs your help. Speak to Fai Dan.

Colonist: I can't tell you anything. Fai Dan is the one you should see.


(Colonist 5)

Colonist: Finally. We can relax a little.

Colonist: I don't have a lot of training. None of the militia survived the first assault.

(Arriving near the transmitter)
| Ashley Williams: The geth have set up a transmitter of some sort.
| Liara T'Soni: Why do you suppose the geth set up a transmitter here?
| Urdnot Wrex: This transmitter belongs to the geth.
| Kaidan Alenko: I wonder what the geth are using this transmitter for?
| Garrus Vakarian: What are the geth doing with that transmitter?

(Dispatching first wave of enemies)
| Tali'Zorah: The transmitter is helping them communicate. We must destroy it.
| Garrus Vakarian: We've got to destroy that transmitter before they send reinforcements.
| Kaidan Alenko: As long as that transmitter is working, they're going to keep coming!
| Urdnot Wrex: Destroy that thing or they'll keep coming.
| Liara T'Soni: We must destroy the transmitter if we hope to stop the geth.

(Dispatching second wave of enemies)
| Ashley Williams: Commander! We've got to destroy that transmitter!
| Liara T'Soni: We must destroy the transmitter or they will overwhelm us.
| Urdnot Wrex: Blow that damn thing up or we're all dead!
| Kaidan Alenko: We've got to destroy that transmitter, Commander!
| Garrus Vakarian: We've got to destroy that transmitter before they overwhelm us!

(Having destroyed the transmitter)
| Tali'Zorah: That's it. I think we've managed to stop them.
| Garrus Vakarian: That was close. I didn't think they'd ever stop coming.
| Kaidan Alenko: Damn. I thought they were just going to keep coming.
| Urdnot Wrex: 'Bout time. Thought they'd never stop.

| Garrus Vakarian: An optimal view of where we need to go.

(Associated with conditional CH2_Feros.Henchmen_Interjections.WAR20_First_Enter_Verran_Tunnels)
| Urdnot Wrex: Careful. Smells like a slaughterhouse. Organic preds, not geth.
| Kaidan Alenko: Ugh, what's that smell? Geth don't stink like that.
| Ashley Williams: Holy... it reeks down here.
| Liara T'Soni: These tunnels have an odor much more... visceral than geth.
| Garrus Vakarian: I smell... carrion. And lots of it.

(Associated with conditional CH2_Feros.Henchmen_Interjections.WAR20_Mid_Way_Through_Verran_Tunnels)
| Kaidan Alenko: The local predators probably ignored the geth. Can't eat metal.
| Ashley Williams: I bet these things ignored the geth. Can't eat metal.
| Liara T'Soni: The varren probably did not recognize the geth as food. We, on the other hand, appear most appetizing.
| Garrus Vakarian: Xenogenic field manuals warn against triggering a food response in local predators. It appears we don't have a choice.
| Tali'Zorah: The geth ignored these beasts. Their only targets were the colony survivors.

| Liara T'Soni: They appear to have grappled through some sort of containment lab.

|| Kaidan Alenko: We find a way to break even one claw and that ship is out of here.
|| Ashley Williams: Whatever. We just need to find a way to break even one claw and that ship is out of here.
|| Liara T'Soni: It is an asset we lacked at the other claws. Dislodge even one claw and that ship will fall.
|| Garrus Vakarian: It may be helpful. If we can dislodge even one claw the ship may fall.
|| Urdnot Wrex: It's no armory, but tear up even one claw and that ship is gone.

(Examining the device)

war40_heajeong[]
Note:  the option "Just pay them off", marked as an "Intimidate" persuasion check, is more or less technically functional. However, since the game can only display one "Intimidate" option at a time, it is never accessible in-game since the other one, "I'll kill you first", will always be displayed prioritarily. Making it accessible again reveals that this option functions properly for the rest of the game, and even transfers correctly to Mass Effect 2 with the appropriate outcome during Illium: Medical Scans. The transcription below is accurate.

Elizabeth Baynham: It's a telepathic life-form living under Zhu's Hope. It's taking control of the colonists there. ExoGeni knew all along.
Juliana Baynham: You won't get away with this, Jeong.
Ethan Jeong: So you keep saying. But nobody's going to miss a few colonists.

(Par) I'm ending this now! (Neu) I can't let you do this. (Ren) They won't miss you, either. (Cha) What about the big picture? (Int) Just pay them off.  Shepard: I won't let you hurt these people any more. Drop your weapon or be prepared to use it!Ethan Jeong: If that's the way it has to be, then come on!(End of conversation) Shepard: You've gone way too far. This ends now.Ethan Jeong: If that's the way it has to be, then come on!(End of conversation) Shepard: You've gone way too far. This ends now.Ethan Jeong: If that's the way it has to be, then come on!(End of conversation) Shepard: Can't you see the inherent potential in this colony? Think of the promotional opportunities!Ethan Jeong: Opportunities? What the hell are you talking about?
(Par) Feros will be a symbol. (Neu) Movie rights and tourism! (Ren) It's a gimmick.  Shepard: They recovered from an alien attack on a frontier world. Add that to your company profile.Ethan Jeong: Well, yeah. No one's ever gone broke playing the "champion of humanity" card. Shepard: Pitch it as "Humanity against all odds!" You could even sell tickets to wealthy adventurers.Ethan Jeong: Nice! I guess it could be left intentionally undeveloped to capitalize on its "rough" appeal. Right? Shepard: Pitch it as "Humanity against all odds!" You could even sell tickets to wealthy adventurers.Ethan Jeong: Nice! I guess it could be left intentionally undeveloped to capitalize on its "rough" appeal. Right?
Juliana Baynham: Sadly, you'd probably make a killing. But if it will let us get back to our lives, I'm for it.Ethan Jeong: It just might work. Wait, no, but the infected colonists will throw a bit of a wrench in that plan. No, no. They need to disappear.Juliana Baynham: You can't just kill the colonists. It's not their fault.Elizabeth Baynham: If you kill only the Thorian, it might be enough to stop the infection. Maybe.

(Par) Sounds logical. (Neu) They'll try to stop me. (Ren) Can't take that chance.  Shepard: It's worth a try, but I don't know if I can avoid harming the colonists. Shepard: Good plan. Except that the colonists stand between me and the Thorian. Shepard: Anything hostile will be eliminated.
Elizabeth Baynham: There has to be another way.Juliana Baynham: Maybe there is. Come and talk to me before you leave, Commander.Ethan Jeong: Just make sure there's no evidence when you're done.(End of conversation) Shepard: Pay them. Give them passage off this world and be done with it.Ethan Jeong: But if word gets out about the Thorian.... [sic] How do I know they'll stay quiet?
(Par) Think about it. (Neu) They won't talk. (Ren) Use your head.  Shepard: They lose even more if they talk. Besides, there's no real crime to report if you let them go. Shepard: If they talk, they lose everything for no reason at all. They'll stay quiet. Shepard: Make the offer sweet enough and they'll take it. And they won't risk losing it all just to talk.
Elizabeth Baynham: I won't shut up! I'll talk about it to anyone who will listen!Ethan Jeong: Then you'd be the first one to go to prison. Your signature's on half the Thorian reports.Elizabeth Baynham: But-- But it's not fair. Not after everything.

(Par) It could be worse. (Neu) I'm done here. (Ren) You're naïve.  Shepard: This isn't so bad. At least you have your life. You can start over anywhere.Elizabeth Baynham: I guess that's all that matters now. Shepard: Let's get this over with.Elizabeth Baynham: Take the money and run. It seems like that's all anyone cares about. Shepard: Life isn't fair, Lizbeth. It's about time you realized that.Elizabeth Baynham: Take the money and run. It seems like that's all anyone cares about.
Ethan Jeong: For this to work, there can't be any evidence. The infected colonists need to disappear.Juliana Baynham: You can't just kill the colonists. It's not their fault.Elizabeth Baynham: If you kill only the Thorian, it might be enough to stop the infection. Maybe.

Juliana Baynham

Juliana Baynham: Thank you. I appreciate that you went out of your way to at least secure us some kind of future. It's too bad, but I guess it couldn't be helped. Sometimes you have to just walk away.

(If Zhu's Hope is bound to survive)
(Colonist 1)

Colonist: Feros can survive. Especially now that we're free again.

Colonist: That plant took my mind, but you made sure it will never happen again. Nothing will stop this colony.

Colonist: Feros is ours again. We'll make sure it stays that way.

Colonist: We were forced to serve that... that plant, but now we have a chance to make this world our home.


(Colonist 2)

Colonist: Feros is ours again. It will be good to get back to business.

Colonist: I can think for myself again! It's like getting a second chance.

Colonist: We'll show the frontier what we are made of.

(Sole Survivor) (War Hero) (Ruthless)  Colonist: You're good at this survival stuff. Guess that's what made you famous. Colonist: Who'd have thought we'd get a war hero on our side? Colonist: I'm surprised you saved this place. Not exactly what you're known for.

(Colonist 3)

Colonist: It'll be good to get back to normal problems.

Colonist: You don't live on the frontier if you can't handle some bruises, I guess.

(Water hasn't been restored) (Water has been restored)  Colonist: If Macha can restore the water, the colony may actually make a go of it.Colonist: Thirst is the biggest threat against us now. Colonist: We might have a chance now, thanks to you.Colonist: I hope the rough times are over.

(Colonist 4)

Colonist: We'll show the galaxy we can't be beaten so easily.

Colonist: We have a chance to make something here after all, no thanks to Colonial Affairs and ExoGeni.

Colonist: It'll take some time, but we'll make this a home.

(Sole Survivor) (War Hero) (Ruthless)  Colonist: It takes a survivor to show us how it's done, I guess. Thanks, Shepard. Colonist: I thought you hero types were all talk. Glad I was wrong. Colonist: Glad you found a way to save this place. I know you aren't shy about tough decisions.
(If Zhu's Hope is going to be abandoned)
(Colonist 1)

Colonist: I'm sorry I ever came here. We need to rethink pushing colonies on the frontier.

Colonist: Earth needs to step back from colonies like this if they won't back us up with heavy weapons.

Colonist: I'm getting the hell off this rock.

(Sole Survivor) (War Hero) (Ruthless)  Colonist: I guess we fared better than some places. Nobody wants another Akuze. Colonist: This isn't the Blitz. You can't always save the day. Colonist: I guess we fared better than some places. Nobody wants another Torfan.

(Colonist 2)

Colonist: I'm through with Feros. There's no reason to stay here.

Colonist: Thanks for freeing us. We're getting the hell out while we can.

Colonist: I'm going back to Earth on the next available ship.

Colonist: If I ever come back, it'll be behind a mass driver the size of Titan.


(Colonist 3)

Colonist: No point in staying here now. Everything was against us from the start.

Colonist: I'll be glad to get out of here.

Colonist: What a waste of our efforts.

Colonist: Thanks for saving us, even if the colony is going under.


(Colonist 4)

Colonist: I've had it with this place. I'm counting myself lucky to get out with my life.

Colonist: Only a fool would stay here after what we have been through.

Colonist: Building a colony here was foolish from the start.

Colonist: No need to tell me twice. Feros is dead, and I'm not staying for the funeral.
