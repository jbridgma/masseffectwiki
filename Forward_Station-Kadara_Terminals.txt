RE: Kadara (Habitat 4)

I can't say I'm happy the exiles found a planet in better shape than most we've seen. Tread carefully with Sloane. To say she's impulsive is an understatement.

Notes from Vetra's Contact.
Displaying…

"Biggest danger on Kadara isn't mother nature—it's the people. After the uprising, a lot of folks went psycho. Sloane keeps the cream of the crop (using the term lightly) up at port, but banishes the rest. The badlands are basically a prison, with mountains for walls and no cells."

Initial request for geographical data from the exiles was denied. Any "back doors" would be appreciated.

Will repay with dextro-chocolate bars!
