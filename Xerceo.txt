Description[]
A hydrogen-helium gas giant, Xerceo's many moons were developed along with the colonization of Altakiril. It is believed that the majority of them were military in nature, a common theme among turian colonies. Specifics are few. Altakiril's government kept its records classified, and the Reapers have systematically destroyed the installations here.
