Pitne For is standing outside the police station in a different position than when you left. You can either give the datapad to Pitne For for 9,000 credits and 5 Renegade points, or you can go inside the police station and give it to Detective Anaya for 4,200 credits and 5 Paragon points, but only after you have talked to Samara.
