Description[]
A large, reflective asteroid, Lucen is almost visible in Thessia's night sky and was discovered soon after the asari developed optics. When the space age finally arrived, the rocky asteroid was among the first to be mined for its valuable deposits of platinum-group metals.
Lucen is named for the servant of the goddess Athame, who beseeched the goddess for the gifts of pottery, forging, and biotics. Lucen then sailed the sea and sky teaching these gifts to mortals. It is said that the aging, powerful matriarch begged Athame for the gift of prophecy, so she would see whether the asari would prosper in the future. Athame refused, prophecy being hers alone, and when Lucen tried to steal it from Athame's silver jars, Athame struck her down.
The Reapers have so far ignored the mining facility on Lucen, as it offers little strategic value and is far from the system's mass relay.
