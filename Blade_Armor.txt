Player Notes[]
The power use penalty at Rank 1 is not a 50% overall reduction to power recharge speed, but a 50% points reduction of the Power Recharge Speed bonus visible in the weapon loadout screen. For example, if you have +200% Power Recharge Speed when looking at the weapons screen, activating Rank 1 Blade Armor reduces that Power Recharge Speed to +150%.
The power speed penalty reduction of 30% with the Rank 6 Power Recharge evolution reduces the penalty from 50% down to 20%. E.g. If you have +200% Power Recharge Speed bonus from a light weapon loadout, activating Rank 6 Blade Armor only reduces that to +180%.
Blade Armor has no effect on instant kill attacks, or Atlas and Brute ground slams.
Blade Armor does work against Husk/Abomination grabs; the husk will take continuous damage during the grapple sequence, and if it is killed by the reflected damage, the grapple ends, freeing the player (also triggering an Abomination's death explosion, which is usually not ideal). However, neither Husks or Abominations are staggered by the reflected damage.
Infantry enemies will often be staggered when their melee attack damage is reflected, but this does not negate any stunning effect their own melee attack may have on you.
Collector Troopers and Collector Captains always strike and deal damage with their melee blades twice; Blade Armor will cause the Collector to stagger back after dealing their first blow, preventing the second.
