Legendary Edition: Of the two semi-automatic sniper rifles available, the Volkov has superior stats compared to the Equalizer. However, according to its description it is less accurate than the other sniper rifles of its class. 





































Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3[]
In Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, Rosenkov Materials manufactures one small arms weapon:

M-97 Viper Sniper Rifle
Rapid-fire military sniper rifle. Incredibly accurate and deadly at long range, these weapons are popular amongst infiltrators and assassins. Very effective against armor, somewhat effective against shields and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Mantis sniper rifle. Rosenkov Materials developed this deadly weapon in response to the rising prevalence of kinetic barriers. While kinetic barriers still offer some protection from this weapon, its sheer power and rapid rate of fire make it capable of quickly killing almost any target, regardless of its defenses.

↑ Mass Effect Prima Official Guide, page 48: Rosenkov Materials' Superior Materials gives +50% in Damage, +6% in Heat Absorption and +35% in Accuracy when compared to baseline stats. Only the Damage calculations appear exact, but clear increases can be observed in the other two nonetheless.

↑ Mass Effect Prima Official Guide, page 48: Rosenkov Materials' Shield VI gives +20% in DP (possibly meant to be +20), but despite a clear increase being observable when compared to baseline stats, calculations don't match exactly.
