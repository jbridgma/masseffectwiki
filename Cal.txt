Mass Effect: Andromeda


Cal runs the Supply by Cal store on Port Meridian. He sells a few weapons.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




When Pathfinder Ryder wonders where he got his supplies, Cal explains "everybody brought their rainy-day toys to the party" Ryder threw. He was only recently brought out of cryostasis, but he immediately opened for business to capitalize on the situation.
