Description[]
Aware that it only takes one weaponized asteroid to destroy the fueling station at Cyone, the asari seeded the asteroid belt in this system with a warning network of sensors and spy drones. The system's "brains" are server clusters at the equidistant asteroids Tropai, Lochia, and Nili, but unobstructed lines of sight are still of little use in spotting incoming Reaper ships traveling at faster-than-light speeds.
