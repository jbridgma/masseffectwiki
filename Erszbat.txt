Description[]
Erszbat was a wealthy batarian colony, rich in farmland, minerals and manufacturing infrastructure. Little recent information about it has escaped this section of space--but radio traffic from the planet paints a dire picture.
Indoctrinated batarian officials are offering rewards for every living body brought to the labor camps, slave or not. With the state apparatus at their disposal, Reaper units are coordinating house-to-house hunts for resistance members, and paying those who turn them in. Government propaganda dismisses the smell of the processing ships as a natural byproduct of Reaper energy consumption. Columns of dust from annihilated cities tell the story of those who disobeyed.
