The Resistance Headquarters' Infirmary is where injured angara convalesce for recovery.





“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Layout[]
The infirmary is located downstairs from the headquarters' main entrance, next to the training room. Entry to the infirmary isn't permitted without first subjecting to a decontamination procedure next to its entrance. Apart from the reception desk, it is equipped with five ion beds that help speed up the healing process when used with native angaran bioelectricity.
The infirmary is run by Olvek.
