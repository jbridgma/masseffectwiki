Captain Vorleon is a salarian Eclipse Captain. 







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




Vorleon is in charge of the men that seized a Eldfell-Ashland Energy refinery on the planet Helyme. He is eventually killed in the firefight when Commander Shepard with the squad arrives to liberate the refinery. 

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Vorleon will attack with his M-9 Tempest and use tech attacks like Combat Drone and Incinerate.
Defensive
Vorleon has strong shields and armor, but moderate health.  He can regenerate his shields using Tech Armor.

Tactics[]
Avoid the other Troopers that come out with him.
Keep in cover to avoid his Incinerate attack.
His combat drone should not be a concern, even on higher difficulties where he will frequently replace it, as it is very weak. A single burst from the M-15 Vindicator will kill it.
