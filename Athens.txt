Athens is a frontier system targeted for development. Humans established a colony on Proteus, and are trying to see if underwater habitats are feasible on the water world. Helium-3 production is slated to commence on Circe as development on Proteus progresses. Salamis has iron and platinum deposits that may make it attractive for mining. Pharos is barely explored, but known to have an abandoned turian base on its moon.
The star Athens is described as "energetic" and subjects the closest planets, Proteus and Salamis, to extreme weather and geological instability.
