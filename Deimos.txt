Deimos is a location which was cut due to being part of the cancelled Mass Effect DLC Mars.

Description[]
The larger of Mars' two tiny moons has been built up as an orbital port. Initially developed by a consortium of European and Russian commercial backers, administration was handed over to the Systems Alliance in 2163.
Today Deimos serves as an entrepot for cargo moving to and from the surface, as well as a customs inspection and medical quarantine for immigrants and visitors. All departures from Mars must pass through Deimos' screening facilities; given the possibility of private explorers discovering Prothean artifacts, all baggage undergoes a thorough inspection.
The Systems Alliance 1st Fleet, nominally based in Arcturus, maintains a cruiser squadron and frigate flotilla at Deimos. They are tasked with protecting the Prothean ruins and assisting customs enforcement.
