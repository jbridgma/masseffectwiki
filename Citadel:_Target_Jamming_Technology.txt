This is another item retrieval mission within a mission. Its parent mission only becomes available after Priority: Geth Dreadnought. While exploring the AA Gun Control facility on Rannoch, look for the Jamming Tower Data at the terminal on the right side wall of the left AA Gun setup.
If the data was missed during the mission, it can be also be purchased for 1,000 credits, before discounts or remote access markups, at the Spectre Requisitions terminal.
Once acquired, deliver it to the C-Sec Officer. Completing this mission gives you 5 Reputation, 30 experience and 1,000 credits. It also updates the Citadel Defense Force War Asset.
