Description[]
A tiny rock planet, Yunaca's atmosphere is a thin sheen of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Yunaca has abundant metals, but Hegemony protectionism makes mining on Aratoht more profitable for batarian corporations. A few aging spy satellites circle it, watching for unlicensed mining operations.
EDI'S TRAVEL ADVISORY: The Batarian Hegemony considers any presence of Alliance military vessels in batarian space as hostile. The Normandy SR2, while an independent vessel, strongly resembles the Normandy SR1, an Alliance ship. Use of stealth systems is highly recommended.
