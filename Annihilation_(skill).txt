Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Unlike Annihilation Field, which only lasted for a limited duration, Annihilation is persistent, and will remain activated until either the player is downed or turns it off.
Sounds are partly distorted inside Annihilation's area of effect, which may present some hindrance if relying on audio cues to take note of the environment.
Strategies
Rank 4 Radius synergizes well with Rank 5 Damage Attractor, meaning that more enemies are debuffed to a greater extent.
Rank 5 Biotic Wind can turn Annihilation into an interesting "travel move", enabling users to cover distance on foot with much greater speed. This is especially useful on Havarl, where the ND1 Nomad cannot be called down, and on various multiplayer maps where move speed is paramount like in object retrieval waves.
Rank 6 Draining Field stacks with other shield-restoration on kill effects. By taking Rank 6 Active Barrier in the Barrier skill and wearing a Shield Oscillator on Ryder's chest armor, it is possible for Ryder to restore a maximum of 80% of their shields every time they kill an enemy.
Availability[]
Single-player: Pathfinder Ryder - Unlocked With 9 Skill Points in Biotic Skills or Leader Training
Multiplayer: Asari Adept, Batarian Vanguard, Krogan Gladiator
