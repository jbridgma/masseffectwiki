Description[]
Eunomia is largely made of ice--frozen around a metal-poor core. Its deposits were of little use to the humans building Arcturus Station, who favored materials from the asteroids towed into the system. Eunomia lies neglected in the void. There is no obvious Reaper presence here.

Trivia[]
Eunomia is named after the Greek name for "Lawfulness" (Greek: Ευνομία).
