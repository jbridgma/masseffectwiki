Mass Effect 2 Original Videogame Score[]
“
Jack Wall's score for Mass Effect 2 perfectly blends classic sci-fi inspired sounds with unique arrangements to achieve an emotionally charged complement to the dramatic, action-packed gameplay.
— Dr. Ray Muzyka, BioWare Co-Founder
Mass Effect 2 Original Videogame Score was released on January 18, 2010 and is the main soundtrack for the Mass Effect 2 video game.
Jack Wall, as lead composer of his audio production team "Wall of Sound", is credited for the composition and production of the Mass Effect 2 score. Team members included Sam Hulick, David Kates, Jimmy Hinson; and additional music, editing, and implementation was made by Brian DiDomenico. Wall, Hulick and Kates returned to work on the Mass Effect 2 video game score after having also worked on the original Mass Effect video game score, and ultimately the first Mass Effect Soundtrack.
In May 2021, BioWare released this soundtrack in a free bonus content download, also featuring items from Deluxe versions of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. It is only available until July 31, 2021 or until download limit is reached. It consists of all the listed songs below, with track numbers adjusted to account for the inclusion of Mass Effect Original Soundtrack and Mass Effect 3 Soundtrack.
