The Geth Stalker is a type of Geth Hopper used by the geth followers of Saren Arterius. Its platform is camouflage-patterned black-on-white, though its body core intermittently glows blue during normal operation.
The Stalker is armed with an array of disabling abilities that wreak havoc on weapon heat systems and personal shields, though they require a few seconds to charge before firing. They can also fire regular energy pulses from their eye that deal toxic damage, though they tend to prioritize using their abilities. Combined with the Hoppers' tremendous agility, Stalkers function as a lightning-quick harassing force on the field.

Tactics[]
Like all Geth Hoppers, Geth Stalkers are lightweight and lightly armored, making them vulnerable to gunfire. The problem is getting them to hold still long enough for a clear shot. Thankfully they are usually encountered indoors, and a Hopper usually leaps back and forth between two positions across a room, allowing you to hit them on their return jump.
Being hit by just one round forces the Stalker to cancel their attack and jump to another location.
Physics-based biotic attacks, especially Throw, will inflict heavy damage against Stalkers. Lift works nicely to hold them in midair, especially if you're using a sniper rifle.
One way to learn what ability the Stalker will use is through the color of the energy around its eye while it prepares to fire. Orange means it will use Sabotage, green means Damping, and yellow means Overload.
