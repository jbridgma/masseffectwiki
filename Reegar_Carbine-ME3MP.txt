Description[]
This electrical weapon improves upon the arc pistol's design by generating a sustained current on its target. This weapon is named for the quarian Reegar family, whose marines have served valiantly against the geth.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
The Reegar Carbine is available after downloading the Mass Effect 3: Firefight Pack.
In Legendary Edition it is available from the Elkoss Combine Arsenal Supplies terminal in the Presidium Commons for a base amount of 10,000 credits.

Multiplayer
Weapons are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The Reegar Carbine is classified as rare and requires the Mass Effect 3: Rebellion Pack.

Player Notes[]
GeneralSingle-playerMultiplayer 
General
The Reegar Carbine is a short range automatic close quarters combat weapon that fires a constant stream of electricity with limited range; despite being called a carbine, the weapon's function is comparable to that of a narrow flamethrower like the M-451 Firestorm.
The trigger must be held a very short amount of time before the weapon actually starts to fire.
While very counterintuitive, the electric current generated by the Reegar Carbine is equivalent to a stream of bullets. This means that all weapon mods and powers that change the properties of bullets work with the Reegar Carbine. Normally, non-bullet type weapons, like the M-37 Falcon or Venom Shotgun, are unable to use/increase the penetration properties of the weapon.
Appropriate ammo powers, equipment, gear, or mods will increase the penetration properties of the Reegar Carbine.
The weapon also has a headshot multiplier and can headshot enemies.
The Reegar also has its damage reduced by enemy armor but can benefit from all debuffs that weaken armor.
It receives no benefit whatsoever from the Shotgun Smart Choke mod.
The Reegar Carbine does 200% bonus damage against shields and barriers but only 50% damage against armor. This may make it a good choice for classes that have no shield-stripping abilities.[1]
A full clip from the Reegar will dissolve the shields or barriers of the toughest foes even on higher difficulties, even without any damage-increasing mods like the Shotgun High Caliber Barrel.
Even against armored foes, the Reegar can do fairly good damage, especially if it is augmented by Incendiary Ammo or Incendiary Rounds due to the high damage tick rate of the weapon and a bug that makes incendiary ammunition stack damage faster than it should (see the Incendiary Ammo notes section for details).
The Reegar Carbine has immense overall power and is capable of killing targets in range in a short amount of time. When first impacting an infantry target it tends to partially stagger them for a brief second, or it immediately induces them to use an evasion move if they possess one to get out of the line of fire.
Balancing out its tremendous rate of damage, the Reegar Carbine burns through its already low ammunition count at an alarming rate. As such, it is highly advisable to have a backup weapon. The Shotgun Spare Thermal Clip mod also helps to mitigate this weakness at least as far as spare ammunition, though this does not improve the weapon's small magazine size.
With its extremely limited range, this weapon tends to favor a more "up close and personal" approach to enemies that leaves the player open to greater retaliation. Vanguards and Infiltrators tend to be most effective with the weapon, since they have powers that can keep them safe at close ranges.
The Reegar Carbine has a moderately slow reload speed that can be greatly shortened by using reload-cancelling techniques.
Tactical Cloak can be used to fire off a whole clip of the Reegar before the damage bonus disappears. The extra damage can kill any foot soldier extremely quickly. This damage bonus makes it effective even against the strongest enemies.
The low clip capacity can be overcome by using Adrenaline Rush or Marksman to auto-reload instantly; however, this burns through spare ammo very quickly.
The Reegar Carbine is useful against Reaper forces as it destroys the bodies of the enemies it kills, denying Cannibals a chance to consume them.
The Reegar is highly effective against Phantoms as most of their toughness comes from their thick barrier which the Reegar melts through easily, though a Phantom will usually try to flip out of the way of Reegar fire immediately, so wait for her to come to a stop before unloading.
A great combination involves combining the Shotgun Spare Thermal Clip mod with the Shotgun High-Velocity Barrel, as the latter effectively combines the Shotgun Shredder Mod and Shotgun High Caliber Barrel into one mod. This will greatly reduce the Reegar Carbine's ammunition problem without sacrificing the damage, penetration, and armor damage increase, albeit with an increase in weight.
Single-player
Firing the Reegar slows Shepard's movement speed.
Powers can be used at the same time this weapon is firing, though doing so displaces the weapon's targeting slightly.
The Reegar can fry Cerberus Guardians through their handheld shields even without the use of any penetration-enhancing mods or powers. The same is not true of CAT6 Heavies' shields—penetration aids are needed.
Enhancing the Reegar Carbine with Armor-Piercing Ammo and/or mods that allow for penetration enable the Reegar to devastate multiple enemies at once and strike through cover; while there is a damage penalty, against shields or barriers this will be largely irrelevant.
The Reegar benefits from the Explosive Burst evolution of Incendiary Ammo, and due to its extreme rate of fire, is particularly devastating with it.
Do not give this weapon to squadmates, as they do not properly gauge its short maximum range and will routinely fire from too far away to hit their targets. An exception to this is Urdnot Wrex during the missions of Mass Effect 3: Citadel where his tendency to attack enemies in melee range makes this not a concern.
Multiplayer
Most classes move slower when firing the weapon (as with the M-76 Revenant and Striker Assault Rifle). Vorcha and drell are slowed the most, while batarians, krogan, and volus are exempted from the movement penalty and can fire the Reegar while maintaining their normal speed.
The Reegar Carbine is one of only a few weapons available in multiplayer with a range cap (the others being the Particle Rifle and the Collector Sniper Rifle). Since this cap is low, this weapon will see better use in classes designed to be able to engage in close-quarters for sustained periods of time, such as Vanguards.
The Reegar is effective when used with a vorcha. The weapon is able to quickly kill enemies, powering their Bloodlust. The vorcha health regeneration from Bloodlust also allows them to close in on enemies much more readily than most other characters. The high mobility of vorcha classes also allows them to quickly rotate between ammunition resupply locations.
The batarian classes suffer less from the ammo problems of the Reeger thanks to the spare ammo evolutions of their passive class power.
Another way of increasing capacity is to use the Thermal Clip Storage gear, which will allow for up to 30% more ammunition to be carried. A Thermal Clip Pack will also fully restore your ammunition level, as well as load your Reegar with ammunition. There is also a temporary damage boost shortly after using a Thermal Clip Pack.
The Reegar in multiplayer does not automatically penetrate Guardian shields, but it's still possible to shoot them through the "mail slot" as with most conventional weapons, though it can be somewhat harder to tell how to aim the electric stream precisely to do so. Adding the Shotgun Shredder Mod to the Reegar Carbine not only allows it to bypass Guardians' shields and kill them as if they were Assault Troopers, but also makes it much more effective against armored enemies.
Combining the Shotgun Shredder Mod's added effectiveness against armor with the Flamer power evolved to do max damage against shields, allows a Vorcha Sentinel, Vorcha Soldier, or Geth Trooper Soldier to methodically and effectively strip the shields or barriers from tough opponents like Banshees, Geth Primes, and Praetorians, and then remove their armor. This weapon's cone is wide enough to effectively set off a Geth Pyro's explosive tank fairly consistently, which further boosts its usefulness against clustered geth.
Enhancing the Reeger with Armor-Piercing Rounds/Drill Rounds enables the weapon to devastate multiple grouped enemies at once and strike through cover. There is no loss of damage as long as no piercing weapon mod that suffers such a damage penalty is equipped on the weapon.

Description[]
Designed by the Milky Way's quarians, the Reegar Carbine is effective against shields and radiates enough energy to harm enemies near the main target. An invisible laser ionizes the air and creates a path for a high amperage electric shock. It was named for the quarian Reegar in recognition of his service against the geth.

Features[]
The gun has a short effective range, with its electric beam dissipating after only a few meters. Unusually for an energy weapon though it can damage enemies through thin walls.
The Reegar Carbine in Andromeda fires a more focused stream of energy compared to the Mass Effect 3 version, which is more akin to an electrical flamethrower in terms of area of effect.
The multiplayer Reegar Carbine doesn't have a Concussive variant. It gained improvements to damage twice and improvements to rate of fire and clip size once during post-launch updates.

Strategies[]
The Reegar Carbine is best employed with close-quarters brawler classes due to its total lack of damage beyond its effective range.
