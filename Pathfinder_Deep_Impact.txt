Description[]
This shotgun feeds data directly to a Pathfinder's SAM, allowing adjustments to the weapon's balance, recoil, and heat buildup. During development, the Deep Impact's sonic signature was reconfigured multiple times to find the noise most likely to intimidate alien wildlife.

Features[]
Like all weapons in the Pathfinder Elite Weapons Set, the Deep Impact is not available above Rank V.
Despite being classified as a Rare weapon, the Deep Impact only has 2 augmentation slots.

Strategies[]
The Deep Impact is available very early in the game, but is already outclassed even by the lowly M-23 Katana in damage and spare ammo count. It does, however, have a slightly larger clip size, is a bit more accurate, and is lightweight enough to be taken by any class without going over weight limits.

Bugs[]
In the development menu, all iterations of the Deep Impact will be found grouped together in the Rank I area.
Despite being fully automatic already, the Deep Impact can have the Automatic Fire System augmentation applied to it. Using this augmentation wastes an augmentation slot and there is no benefit to using this augmentation with this weapon.
