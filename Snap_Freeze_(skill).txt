Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Snap Freeze and Cryo Beam are similar skills with crucial differences. Snap Freeze instantaneously freezes enemies in its path while Cryo Beam requires a couple of seconds' sustained output to freeze its targets. Snap Freeze only has limited range while Cryo Beam can reach far enemies as long as they appear on the targeting HUD.
As with all freezing debuffers, Snap Freeze has little effect on shielded enemies unless their shields are stripped first.
Strategies
The only two classes that can Snap Freeze are both close-range brawlers who can use the skill to set up cryo explosions. The Batarian Scrapper can detonate using his Batarian Gauntlet and/or Concussive Shot while the Human Juggernaut can detonate with Shockwave.
Adhi and Breachers are particularly vulnerable to Snap Freeze, stopping dead in their tracks for the former or even shattering upon dropping to the floor for the latter.
