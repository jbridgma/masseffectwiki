Asgard is the first extrasolar system developed by humanity with the use of the Charon Relay. The colony there, Terra Nova, turned out to be rich in platinum, and the resulting platinum rush helped drive construction of hydrogen and helium-3 production infrastructure on the gas giants. As of 2183, Asgard's hydrogen fuel cells have cornered nearly 4% of the galactic market. However, threats of batarian attack cause many to emigrate in recent years rather than risk their fortunes here.
During the Reaper invasion of the galaxy in 2186, much of the system's production facilities were destroyed. The Alliance withdrew to assess whether to wait for reinforcements to take it back or join the battle elsewhere. They still put up a fight even in defeat, evidenced by enemy wreckage littering Borr or ground units still hiding in Loki's subterranean tunnels.
