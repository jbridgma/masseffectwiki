Mass Effect 3 Original Videogame Score[]
“
With Mass Effect 3, we're taking players on a more personal journey, even though the scope is bigger than ever - an all-out galactic war! Each composer has played an intricate role in delivering the combination of epic scope and delicate emotion that will make Mass Effect 3 the best game in the series.
— Casey Hudson, Project Director
The Mass Effect 3 Soundtrack was composed by Sascha Dikiciyan & Cris Velasco, who composed the scores for Mass Effect 2 DLC packs Kasumi's Stolen Memory and Arrival; Sam Hulick, who worked on the scores for Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2; Christopher Lennertz, who composed the scores for Mass Effect 2 DLC packs Overlord and Lair of the Shadow Broker; and Clint Mansell, known for scoring films such as Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain. Faunts returned to provide a song for the credits, "Das Malefitz", after an absence from Mass Effect 2.
Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 Composer Jack Wall did not return for Mass Effect 3. Several tracks from the previous games do return, though they are not included on the soundtrack.
The soundtrack was initially available only through purchase of the Mass Effect 3 N7 Collector's Edition or Digital Deluxe Edition, though it became available on the iTunes store on April 24, 2012 at a cost of US$6.99.[1]
In May 2021, BioWare released this soundtrack in a free bonus content download, also featuring items from Deluxe versions of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. It is only available until May 31, 2021 or until download limit is reached. It consists of all the listed songs below, with track numbers adjusted to account for the inclusion of Mass Effect Original Soundtrack and Mass Effect 2 Soundtrack.[2]
