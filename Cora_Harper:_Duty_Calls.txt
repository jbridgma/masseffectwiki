Speak To Cora On The Tempest[]
Go to the navpoint on the Tempest and speak with Cora.
Cora will say that she has a report of a serious lighting issue in Ryder's quarters. Ryder can those choose to stay or go to the quarters.
Choosing to go to Ryder's quarters leads to a kiss with Cora.
After the first kiss, Ryder can choose "I want you" or "No sex. Just stay." 

Choosing "No sex" leads to a rather sweet stargazing session.
Choosing "I want you" leads to a racy graphic sex scene, followed by some snuggling, and a reminder from SAM that he is always there.
Either choice ends the mission.

Aftermath[]
Depending upon Ryder's final choice, one of two emails will arrive.
After a night of stargazing:




Thinking about you 
To: Ryder
From: Cora

I've had some good nights. Walked through waist-deep dewy grass on an alien world, watching the sky for hints of dawn. Sat up all night with my sister huntresses around a campfire that burned the color of witchfire. 

Last night with you is my new favorite.

Thinking of you 
To: Ryder
From: Cora

Since SAM was kind enough to interruptâ€¦ just leaving a kiss here in case you need one later.
