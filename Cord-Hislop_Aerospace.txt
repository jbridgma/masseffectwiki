Cord-Hislop is actually used by Cerberus as a front to fund their activities. Paul Grayson was assigned to Cord-Hislop's sales department when he adopted Gillian Grayson, and eventually climbed to the executive ranks as a cover for his work with Cerberus.
Few people in the company know who they are actually working for. The Illusive Man has dozens of agents at every level of the company.

Following Grayson's transformation into a Reaper-controlled puppet, he visits Grissom Academy intending to learn about the Ascension Project.

Trivia[]
The company is likely named after Eva Coré and Ben Hislop, two of the Illusive Man's friends who died in the aftermath of the First Contact War.
