The Kett Tactical Operations Center is a side entrance to the Kett Base on Voeld. It is lightly defended, though it is protected by an encrypted security shield with a passcode that changes every few weeks.
Layout[]
The operations center is a winding cave system into the mountain that emerges into a bridge a few meters below the base's security center. It has roughly four sections, with the shielded entrance at the second section. Dozens of crates  and heaters litter the insides of the cave as well as health and ammo supply caches.
