The Central Wilds is a region on Havarl east of Pelaav Research Station. South of it lies one of the area's monoliths, further east is the Chasm of the Builders, and to the north is the entrance to the Remnant Abyss.
A raised Remnant platform with several jutting small columns around a short tower is a distinctive mark of the area. It used to have a walkway connecting it to the Pelaav outpost, but the walkway has since fallen into ruin. This platform also has room for a Forward Station.
Jaal Ama Darav advises being on alert against roving Roekaar in the area, as well as to avoid eating the local plants.

Message to Avela
Translated from Shelesh:

I know you told me not to go near the ancient crash site that surfaced, but I had to give it a shot. You were right–too difficult to get there. Remnant chased us off before we got halfway to the ravine. Hopefully you can get here yourself. You were always good at dodging those machines.

Though I don't know how safe it'll be with those outsiders roaming around… the spiky ones. Have you seen them? I don't know how to feel about it.

I got off track. The point is, you were right. We're still studying the monolith, but I'll let you know if we find anything you can mention in the Repository.
