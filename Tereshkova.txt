It is named after Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman to fly in space.
Tereshkova is a binary system with Tereshkova-A in the center; unlike Vamshi their combined energy is low (and the system is more explicable). It appears to be in a state of change. Patamalrus is set to lose its atmosphere and Mawinor to be ejected entirely.
