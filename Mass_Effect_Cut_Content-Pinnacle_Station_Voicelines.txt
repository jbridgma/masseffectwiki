Characters present:

Tadius Ahern
Commander Shepard

Tadius Ahern: Ah, Commander Shepard. I was wondering when you'd be gracing my station with your presence. Welcome to Meditatus Station. The majority of your training will take place in the Combat Simulator. We'll see how you fare against the other competitors.

(Par) Thanks for having me (Neu) Thanks (Ren) Don't waste my time (Inv) A simulator?  Shepard: It's an honor to be here, Gunnery Sargent [sic] Shepard:"I suppose you will [sic] Shepard: I'll be fine [sic] Shepard: Tell me about the simulator [sic]Tadius Ahern: Shepard, it's my job to ensure that each operatives [sic] recieves [sic] the correct training and makes progress towards meeting the goals of the council. [sic] If you need to know how the computers work, go to talk [sic] to Tech Specialist Ochren.
(Par) Sounds good (Neu) Thanks (Ren) Don't waste my time  Shepard: I hope to make the most of it [sic] Shepard: I'll be fine [sic] Shepard: This better be worth it [sic]
Tadius Ahern: Fantastic. Is there anything else you need?

(Neu) I've gotta go (Inv) Investigate  Shepard: I'll be going, then.(End of conversation)
(Inv) Other competitors? (Inv) Simulator location? (Inv) Your mood  Shepard: Who will I be competing against?Tadius Ahern: The best of the best. The Top Gun competition gives operatives a chance to put their money where their mouth is, wherever that happens to be. Scores in the combat simulator are tallied up, and the winners are there, plain as day.(Return to last choice) Shepard: Where do I go to use the simulator?Tadius Ahern: The staging area's down that hall. Tech Ochren will be running the show from there. Shepard: You seem a little bitter. Is the station that bad?Tadius Ahern: This facility is magnificent Shepard. [sic] It has all the technological marvels a commander needs to train the perfect soldier. But the damn Turians [sic] seem insistent on keeping it running below it's [sic] potential.
(P Inv) Turians? (R Inv) Seems strange  Shepard: What problem do you have with the Turians? [sic]Tadius Ahern: "Shepard, I lost a lot of good friends in the contact war, and I had to waste a lot of perfectly good bullets getting the Turians [sic] to say they were sorry. Now I'm stuck on a station full of them trying to make them better soldiers. Teaching a Turian [sic] soldier to improvise on the battlefield is like teaching a Krogan [sic] to be pretty.(Return to last choice) Shepard: Why would you accept a position on a Turian facility if you hate them so much?Tadius Ahern: Well apparently whoever was picking up the bodies after the war noticed that a lot of Turian [sic] asses had the same bootprint on them. When the council [sic] asked Alliance brass for a combat instructor, someone decided I was the best choice.(Return to last choice)

Alud Ochren
Commander Shepard

Alud Ochren: Sigh ... Tech specialist Alud Ochren. I'm the lead programmer on the combat simulator, and I keep most of the computer systems on this rig running. I'm also the one people come crying to when they forget their login password.

Were you planning on actually going into the simulator at some point, Commander? Most people find they get the most out of the experience that way.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Alud Ochren: What do you need?(Return to last choice)
(Inv) Your mood (Inv) The simulator (Inv) Objectives  Shepard: What's with the attitude?Alud Ochren: I'm a technical genius on a station full of soldiers who only respect battlefield prowess. It's more than a little frustrating.
(Par) You do good work (Neu) Chin up (Ren) wah, wah, wah  Alud Ochren: The work you do helps these people do their jobs. Helps them help other people.Alud Ochren: It's just that it would be nice to get credit for it once in a while.(Return to over-arching choice) Shepard Maybe someday they'll thank you [sic]Alud Ochren: I suppose so [sic](Return to over-arching choice) Shepard: It must be tough for you, being the only whiner.Alud Ochren: I don't care whether people think I'm tough.(Return to over-arching choice) Shepard: So how does this simulator work?Alud Ochren: Combination of holographic images and kinetic barriers. Holographic images help you see the objects, and the kinetic barriers keep you from walking through them.
(P Inv) Entirely holographic?  Shepard: And I assume that the enemies are holographic as well?Alud Ochren: No, those are real guys. We train our operatives in a simulator by having them kill real, actual people.
(P Inv) Ok, then (R Inv) You disgust me  Shepard: So... that's a "no". Shepard: Very funny, smartass.
Alud Ochren: They're simulated. But I hear the kinetic slugs hurt just the same.(Return to over-arching choice) Shepard: What are the objectives in the simulator?Alud Ochren: Well, that depends on the category of the scenario.
(Neu) I'm done (Inv) Time attack? (Inv) Capture and Hold? (Inv) Convoy? (Inv) New York Minute? (Inv) Survival?  Shepard: I.. think I'm set on the objectives for now.(Return to over-arching choice) Shepard: What are the objectives in Time Attack Mode?Alud Ochren: sooo ... [sic] In time attack mode, the operative and his or her squad must defeat all enemies as quickly as possible. The operative will be scored based on time taken to complete the scenario.(Return to last choice) Shepard: What are the objectives in Capture and Hold Mode?Alud Ochren: uhhh ... [sic] In Capture and Hold mode, the operative and his or her squad must capture all designated control points in as little time as possible. The operative will be scored based on time taken to complete the scenario.(Return to last choice) Shepard: What are the objectives in Convoy Mode?Alud Ochren: uhhh ... [sic] In Convoy mode, the operative and his or her squad must reach as many checkpoints as possible without taking any casualties. All members of a squad must pass through a checkpoint for the checkpoint to be counted. The scenario will be terminated upon the loss of any squad member. The operative will be scored based on the number of checkpoints reached.(Return to last choice) Shepard: What are the objectives in New York Minute Mode?Alud Ochren: sigh ... [sic] In New York Minute mode, the operative and his or her squad must defeat as many enemies as possible before the countdown timer reaches zero. Additional time will be awarded for every enemy defeated. The operative will be scored based on the number of enemies defeated.(Return to last choice) Shepard: What are the objectives in Survival Mode?Alud Ochren: uhhh ... [sic] In Survival mode, the operative must fend off waves of enemies for as long as possible. The scenario will be terminated upon the loss of the squad leader. The operative will be scored based on the length of the mission.(Return to last choice)

Alud Ochren: Well, that's ... never happened before. These scenarios aren't supposed to be that beatable.

(Par) Need help? (Neu) Ain't no thing (Ren) I'm used to it  Shepard: I guess they need to be tuned [sic] Shepard: Should I be sorry? Shepard: I'm very good [sic]
Alud Ochren: Ahern isn't going to like this. He's going to make me fix it. I hope you're happy, Shepard.

(Par) I can help! (Neu) Not really (Ren) I was born happy  Shepard: I'd be happy to help you out [sic] Shepard: Sorry to hear that [sic] Shepard: You should have done your job the first time [sic]
Alud Ochren: Shepard, I need to get back to work. I have a scenario in beta that should whip the pants off anyone, including a SpecTRe. [sic] Go play with that and get out of my horns.

(Par) Not now (P Inv) My pleasure (Inv) Let's try it (R Inv) See you soon  Shepard: Not now [sic]Olud Ochren: Fine, just go away then. Shepard: Glad to try it out [sic]Olud Ochren: Good ... great.

Characters present:

Commander Shepard
Unknown character

Unknown character: Commander, I saw your squad has achieved quite a bit in the Capture and Hold category. That's quite unusual for a human.

(Par) Nothing but hard work (Neu) Oh, you can read? (Ren) We are unstoppable  Shepard: Yeah, we're working hard [sic] Shepard: That's what the numbers say [sic] Shepard: We've been mopping up [sic]
Unknown character: Yes, I suppose so. It's quite an accomplishment, especially for the first human spectre. [sic]

(Par) I have to be the best (Neu) I sweat action (Ren) The universe is next  Shepard: There's a lot of pressure. The eyes of the galaxy are on me. Shepard: It's taken a lot of work [sic] Shepard: It's about time the galaxy saw what we can do.
Unknown character: It will do the humans good to get some of the attention they seem to so desperately crave. Unfortunately, my squad's missions are all covert, so even the most important ones go unnoticed. Ochren's actually been asked to code up a scenrio [sic] based on one of our operations. You should try it Shepard, I'd be curious to see if you can complete the mission as efficiently as we did.

(Neu) I've gotta go (Inv) Capture and Hold  Shepard: I should be going [sic]Unknown character: Very well, Commander. Shepard: I'd like to try your Capture and Hold scenario [sic]Unknown character: Very well, I shall inform tech Ochren that someone shall be participating in it.

Unknown character: Very true. Listen, Shepard. They recently removed a scenario from the competition. It seems there were some concerns that it was unreasonably difficult. My team was the only one to finish it. I'm curious to see how your squad would fare. Let me know if you're interested and I'll pull some strings.

(Neu) I've gotta go (Inv) Convoy  Shepard: I have to go [sic]Unknown character: Keep in mind what I said, Shepard. Shepard: I'd like to try your convoy scenario [sic]Unknown character: Excellent, I'll make sure Ochren knows you might want to try it.

Vidinos: Hey Shepard, don't think that having your name on that scoreboard means that you're the best in the Road Rage category.

(Par) I disagree (Neu) Are you dense? (Ren) Tough talk  Shepard: I don't need to be the best. Just being invited here was honor enough [sic] Shepard: My name's at the top. That's exactly what it means [sic] Shepard: I don't need a scoreboard to know that [sic]
Vidinos: The council [sic] may have thought it was a cute little stunt to let you into the Spectres. But on my station, I promise you, we earn every honor we're given.

(Par) That's not fair (Neu) Spare me (Ren) Put up or shut up  Shepard: I don't consider myself an exception. Shepard: In case you weren't watching, I just earned mine. Shepard: Then perhaps this isn't your station anymore [sic]
Vidinos: None of those scenarios are even tough. You should try a real scenario sometime. [sic] The one the other security guys and I train on.

(Neu) Gotta run (Inv) Unlock Road Rage  Shepard: I should be going [sic]Vidinos: Yeah... you should. Shepard: I'd like to try your Road Rage scenario [sic]Vidinos: I'll go tell Ochren. I'm gonna enjoy watching you fail at this Shepard. [sic]

Tadius Ahern: Shepard, there's a scenario that I don't get to recommend very often. It's incredibly difficult. No human has ever completed it. Several operatives have gotten seriously injured attempting it. I want you to give it a shot.

(Neu) I don't think so (Inv) Sounds intriguing  Shepard: Goodbye [sic]Tadius Ahern: Back to work, Shepard. Shepard: I'd like to try the scenario you mentioned [sic]Tadius Ahern: Spectacular. I'll inform Ochren. It'll be available to at [sic] the simulator from now on.
