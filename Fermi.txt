Description[]
Fermi is a rock wrapped in a haze of carbon dioxide and oxygen, though its temperatures and concentrations make it difficult to support life. Many moons and debris are in its immediate vicinity, leading researchers to believe that at some point Fermi was impacted by something large, launching fragments of the planet into orbit.
The wreckage from a scientific station can be detected here--more evidence of the Reapers' presence in the system.

Trivia[]
Fermi is possibly named for Italian-American physicst Enrico Fermi.
