“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The Andromeda Initiative Embassy on Aya is the organization's diplomatic presence on the planet. It aims to foster greater ties and alliances with the Heleus Cluster's native angara. It becomes accessible shortly after the recovery of Vehn Terev's kett transponder on Kadara, and Director Jarun Tann sends an email notification about it.

The embassy is inside the capital city's Governor's Office. It is a small square room with office desks to the south, a kitchen to the west, and numerous computer screens everywhere else. A holographic projector at the center can receive transmissions from the Nexus or project its likeness, and the two long benches surrounding it complete the necessary setup for conferencing capability.
