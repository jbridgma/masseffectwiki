Description[]
Renshato is close-orbiting "Hot Jupiter" with traces of sulphur in its hydrogen-helium atmosphere. The disruptive gravity well of the gas giant prevented any planets from forming nearby.

Trivia[]
Renshato is too small (and hot) for a "hydrogen-helium atmosphere" to define it (William Hubbard, The New Solar System 4th ed, 1999; p. 194). It is more likely a dense "ice giant" like Neptune or Gliese 436 b.
