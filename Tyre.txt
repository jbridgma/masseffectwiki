Description[]
Tyre is wrapped in a crushing atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon monoxide that make for a blistering oven of a planet. Clouds of ash from volcanic eruptions trigger frequent lightning storms on the surface, and the majority of its mineral deposits are metal-poor, not worth the expense of mining.

Trivia[]
Tyre is likely named after a city in Lebanon, similar to how most other locations in the Petra Nebula, including the nebula itself, are named after locations in the Levant.
