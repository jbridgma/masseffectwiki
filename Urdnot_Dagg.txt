Urdnot Dagg is a krogan who leads Aralakh Company if Grunt didn't survive the suicide mission or was never released from his tank.







“There won't be an Earth left to save...” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 3 follow.




Either Urdnot Wrex or Urdnot Wreav chooses Urdnot Dagg to lead Aralakh Company. Dagg leads Aralakh Company on a mission to investigate a missing krogan scout team on Utukku, with assistance from Commander Shepard. When Dagg first meets Shepard, he expresses both admiration and jealousy that Shepard has the Reapers as enemies, wondering what the Commander must have done to earn such a reputation. If Shepard answers that Dagg also came highly recommended, Dagg will reveal that the reason he was chosen as leader is because he is a respected and feared soldier who his superiors believed would help Aralakh Company achieve greater unity. Dagg knows his company, boasting that every krogan under his command wants blood; if Shepard is female and quips that she will try to leave some for them, Dagg barks approvingly that "the female has bite!"
Like most krogan, Dagg is eager for action, so much so that when Shepard first falls into the nest to begin the mission, Dagg assumes the Commander was intentionally charging into battle. However, at a moment when Shepard's squad can personally observe Aralakh Company battling rachni, Dagg has more trouble than Grunt would in his place, pinned down and unable to break cover.
Dagg later sacrifices himself, fending off a swarm of Ravagers to buy time for Commander Shepard's squad to escape. Unlike Grunt, there is no way to save Dagg; whether Shepard chooses to save Aralakh Company or the Rachni Queen/Breeder, Dagg will always die from being overwhelmed by Ravagers.
