A skull belonging to an unknown creature can be found in the Armstrong Nebula on the planet Maji orbiting Vamshi. This "odd skull" can be found in between the crashed probe and the ancient debris. 
According to Commander Shepard's hardsuit computer the skull does not match any species in its xenobiology database. Apparently the skull shows signs of injury from heavy weapons fire, so the creature might have been brought to Maji as part of the 'death match' entertainment practiced by pirates from the Terminus Systems.

Trivia[]
The name of the skull changes from "Odd Skull" to "Strange Skull" after scanning.
The model is named WormNeck_Skull_01 in Mass Effect's game files. In Mass Effect 3, Harvesters are sometimes called wormnecks. Given the Harvester's rather complicated history being cut content, it is likely the skull was intended to be from a Harvester prior to any subsequent retools.
