Nith is a blue giant with no habitable planets. It was an important refueling system during the Krogan Rebellions, supplying the krogan with helium-3 and antiproton fuels. Spectre sabotage during the war crippled its infrastructure, and in recent times what remains of its orbital facilities are squatted on by undesirables. The Council Demilitarization Enforcement Mission (CDEM) and the krogan themselves consider these squatters beneath notice.
Of its three worlds, only Mantun has significant amounts of resources remaining.
