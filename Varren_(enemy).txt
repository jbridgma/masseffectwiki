Varren




Type
Organic


Armament
None (melee)


Abilities
 Berserker Charge


Health
Moderate


Locations
Feros


Varren are only encountered on Feros. These varren are sometimes killed by the colonists for their meat, and a lair of them can be cleared out in the tunnels beneath Zhu's Hope. Another group infests the ExoGeni headquarters garage, attacking en masse after the encounter with Lizbeth Baynham. 

Tactics[]
Varren bites ignore shields and damage health directly. Keep them out of melee range as much as possible.
Varren tend to attack in large numbers, so keep moving around, shooting, and using Talents to avoid their bite.
Biotic talents like Throw, Lift, and in particular Singularity are the most effective way of neutralizing attacking packs.
Weapons equipped with High Explosive Rounds, particularly sniper rifles, are good at knocking groups of varren off their feet and preventing them from closing in.
Grenades upgraded with cryo payloads are highly effective against grouped varren, potentially freezing many of them at once.

Varren can be found infesting numerous places Shepard can visit in 2185. The creatures can be encountered feral on numerous worlds or as attack dogs assisting the Blood Pack in their various operations. 

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Varren have a powerful bite, but they have to get close to use it.
Defensive
Varren have a moderate amount of health, and low armor on higher difficulties.

Tactics[]
Because varren have to get close in order to attack, it is advisable that you keep them at a distance.
Varren are rarely encountered alone and instead usually attack in groups.  Don't underestimate their ability to overwhelm your squad.
Powers such as Throw, Pull, and Shockwave, even on higher difficulties can help keep varren at bay, though on higher difficulties their armor must be stripped before biotics and other force powers can fully affect them.
Varren are some of the fastest enemies in the game, so fast that they can actually evade many of Shepard's powers by outrunning the projectiles.  Lead and aim powers carefully or use instantaneous powers such as Slam, Reave, or Neural Shock to counter this.  Squadmate powers are usually instant as well.
Reave and Incinerate are not only effective against their armor on higher difficulties but when used against their health bars will stun varren as they do most organic enemies.
If varren get close, Shotguns or Heavy Pistols equipped with an anti-armor ammo power are a great way of busting through their armor.  The shots of the M-300 Claymore and the fully charged shots of the Geth Plasma Shotgun are able to one-shot them even on Insanity if properly modded and upgraded.
Squad Cryo Ammo is an excellent way of dealing with multiple varren attacking at once, especially if the party is equipped with assault rifles such as the Mattock that reliably apply the freezing effects.
Varren do a large amount of damage in melee range and Shepard's melee attacks don't stagger varren as they do most humanoid opponents.  Engaging in melee should be a last resort.
Varren are not panicked by the burning effects of  Incendiary Ammo.
Varren are quite single-minded and Combat Drones aren't very good at distracting them. They also aren't stunned by either the drone's attacks or the detonation of Explosive Drone even when unprotected.  When a drone does successfully get a varren's attention, one bite is usually enough to destroy it.
Heavy weapons aren't wrong to use if you are truly being overwhelmed.  The M-622 Avalanche and the Arc Projector are the best options, though if using the Avalanche remember that freezing effects take a few seconds to work and in that time enemies can still attack until fully frozen.
