Description[]
Nonviable[]
A moistureless, sweltering landscape covered by a large number of cover-subsistence sinkholes, Elaaden still supports life to a limited degree. The fledgling krogan colony of New Tuchanka is here, along with what appear to be abandoned mining facilities, scattered outposts and camps.
Temperature range is 52C to 99C. Exposure to direct sunlight is not recommended.

Viable[]
The activated Remnant vault has increased the presence of cloud-forming particulates in Elaaden's sky. Though the moon is still brutally hot, moisture levels have noticeably risen, increasing ambient humidity and the likelihood of rain. The Nexus scientists advise that the inhabitants of Elaaden, once starved for water, should prepare for flash floods.
If Pathfinder Ryder gave the Remnant drive core to Nakmor Morda:
A sweltering landscape with rising humidity, Elaaden is home to the outpost New Tuchanka, which is a cooperative venture between the Initiative and the krogan colony. (Founded by Nakmor Morda, Pathfinder Ryder; Mayor Kariste Archana elected.)

Codex Entry[]

Initial Entry[]
Elaaden is the scorching desert moon of a gas giant. Identified on Initiative charts as Habitat 2, Elaaden was considered a "golden world," despite its harsh conditions, because of the moon's vast mineral wealth. Tidal gravitational effects cause plumes of sodium silicate to erupt from Elaaden's core, depositing unusually pure silicon sand across the surface—invaluable for manufacturing high-performance computer hardware. 
Orbital surveys show that contrary to projections, Elaaden is almost devoid of water vapor, making long-term settlement or mining efforts unlikely. Those who live on Elaaden face a constant struggle for survival. Able
to thrive in environments that would kill most organic species in days, the krogan who departed the Nexus
have established a colony on Elaaden and defend their sovereignty fiercely. The Nexus advises travelers to avoid Elaaden if possible. 

Elaaden Outpost Established[]
After the gift of a valuable Remnant drive core, the krogan colony of New Tuchanka is now allied with the Initiative. Overlord Morda shares leadership with the Initiative's assigned representative, Kariste Archana. The Nexus is gathering a negotiation team to draw up mineral and water claims on Elaaden. There is no data on whom the krogan are choosing as negotiators.

Elaaden Vault Activated[]
The activated Remnant vault has increased the presence of cloud-forming particulates in Elaaden's sky. Though the moon is still brutally hot, moisture levels have noticeably risen, increasing ambient humidity and the likelihood of rain. The Nexus scientists advise that the inhabitants of Elaaden, once starved for water, should prepare for flash floods.

Anomaly[]
Architect Husk: Elaaden[]
Note:  This anomaly is available after completing Architect on Elaaden.
DATA:
Classification: Enemy (decommissioned)
Origin: Andromeda (Elaaden)
ANALYSIS:
This Remnant Architect's programming directives have been interrupted. It is in an orbital standby mode and remains tethered to its home planet Elaaden. From this unique vantage point, it's clear that the extreme heat of the planet had begun to degrade (i.e. fry) vital systems. Many systems seem to be incorrectly pinging "all clear".

Environmental Information[]
Main article: Hazard
Elaaden is a tidally-locked desert world with scorching levels of heat prior to activation of its vault. All areas not in constant deep shade or indoors pose an environmental hazard to personnel and vehicles. According to SAM, being trapped on a sinkhole without shelter would cause certain death as one's blood would boil in 75 seconds.

SAFE CONDITION - TEMPERATURE 39.96°C
Hazard Level 1 - TEMPERATURE 50.98°C
Hazard Level 3 - TEMPERATURE 69.22°C
Hazard Level 4 - TEMPERATURE 1,231.97°C
Trivia[]
The name "Elaaden" is likely derived from Arabic "العدن" for "The Eden."
