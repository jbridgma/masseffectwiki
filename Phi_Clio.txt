Phi Clio is believed to have been discovered through independent FTL exploration and was once inhabited, as evidenced by resource infrastructures on its two worlds. Home to one terrestrial planet and one gas giant, the former does not exist in Citadel databases, suggesting deliberate deletion. 
Cyllene rates poorly in resources while Parnassus rates rich in resources, particularly iridium. Both have no eezo deposits.
