Unique Dialogue[]
On the Citadel:
When inquiring about Executor Pallin's views on Spectres, Pallin says that he's never had to bend the law. To this, Ashley replies, "Yeah, right. you expect us to believe that none of your officers are corrupt?" if the other squadmate is anyone else but Wrex.
Citadel: Asari Consort assignment:
If Ashley was romanced, when meeting the consort for the first time Ashley jealously asks what she wants with the Commander.
If Shepard was able to convince Septimus to stop spreading lies about Sha'ira and Kaidan is in your party, he says that it's hard to imagine how one woman could upset a general. Ashley explains it's because he doesn't understand women.
When traveling the Wards Ashley, Kaidan and Shepard notice a view and take a break. One of them observes that the Council might dislike humans. Shepard responds "Why not? We've got oceans, beautiful women, this emotion called love. According to the old vids, we have everything they want." Ashley responds to a male Shepard: "If you expect me to get into a tinfoil miniskirt and some thigh-high boots, I want dinner first. Sir."
During Citadel: Expose Saren:
If Ashley is brought to Chora's Den with Kaidan and Shepard decides to spare the warehouse workers she'll say "I can't believe that worked."
If Wrex is in the party and he kills Fist, Ashley points her gun at him demanding he "Drop the gun, krogan!"
During the Citadel: Signal Tracking assignment, when Shepard asks the AI if the matter can be resolved peacefully Ashley vehemently disagrees if the other squadmate is anyone else but Tali: "What are you, crazy? Itâ€™s an AI, like the Geth, it would kill us all if it could!"
Citadel: Homecoming assignment:
When first talking to Samesh Bhatia and he mentions his wife served in the 212, Ashley will recognize that he is talking about Serviceman Nirali Bhatia and introduces herself as a Gunnery Chief who served in her unit. Samesh recognizes Williams and tells her his wife spoke about her with great respect and Ashley will say she is sorry for his loss and ask what they can do for him.
If Nirali's body is returned to Samesh and Shepard informs him of the situation, he will pleased to hear the news. Before he leaves, Ashley tells him that his wife loved him, often complaining about missing his cooking and played recordings of Samesh every night before she fell asleep.
If Nirali's body stays with the Alliance and Shepard informs Samesh of the situation via persuasion, he will not be pleased to hear that his wife's body is being held for experiments. Ashley tells him she died fighting for what she believed in, keeping him safe, and she would want to make the most of that sacrifice, greatly calming Samesh down.
If Nirali's body stays with the Alliance and Shepard informs Samesh of the situation bluntly, he leaves angrily at Shepard's unwillingness to help. Ashley's dismayed: though she knows the tests are important, she thinks they could have found another way to break the news. Whatever Shepard's response, she reiterates they could've found another way.
During the Citadel: Rita's Sister assignment, if the weapon mods peacefully without trying to fight or arrest Jax, Ashley jokes with "Nobody died". If Kaidan is around he sarcastically responds he could shoot someone if it would make Ashley "feel better". Ashley declines and says she's good.
At the beginning of Citadel: Snap Inspection, if the other squadmate is anyone else but Kaidan, Ashley audibly snaps to attention and salutes Rear Admiral Mikhailovich.
While talking to Charles Saracino, Ashley overrides all other squadmates' opinions on the matter:
When Saracino expresses support for gunpoint diplomacy, Ash opines that the Terra Firma protesters are just looking for a reason to whine. Saracino disagrees, citing the backlog of grievances starting from Shanxi, at which point Ash angrily tells him to "shut [his] piehole" as he wasn't there. Shepard can either ease her down gently or harshly.
If Shepard belittles Saracino's comparative lack of military experience, Saracino claims he, as a politician, could convince people why they should support the Commander's efforts. Ashley also disses Saracino's job, rhetorically asking if wearing a ribbon on his lapel makes him a hero. Ash wants him to get out of his office and pitch in if he truly wants to help humanity.
If Saracino is asked what Terra Firma stands for, he proclaims that "Earth must stand firm from alien influence." Ashley is unimpressed, pointing out the racism of many of their members.
At the conclusion of the UNC: Asari Diplomacy assignment, if Shepard tells Nassana Dantius that her sister deserved to die, Nassana agrees and coldly disavows her as well. Ashley's relieved she doesn't have Nassana as a sister. Otherwise, in the other two scenarios Nassana confesses they had trust issues in their family. Ashley replies "Obviously."
During the mission on Therum:
After taking the first elevator in the ruins Ashley asks Shepard to dare her to spit off the side.
Just before rescuing Liara, Ashley will question Shepard if they can trust her since her mother works for Saren.
When Joker is coming to save them from the collapsing ruin, Ash takes note of the timing: "Gonna be close Skipper."
On Noveria:
If Shepard has the Earthborn background, Administrator Anoleis insults the homeworld. If Shepard rises up to the provocation Ashley chimes in that Anoleis better show some respect.
While talking to Lorik Qui'in about Matriarch Benezia, Qui'in will comment on Benezia's outfit and the reaction it had with the younger males. Williams will pipe up and blame the extranet and video games for the wild views of males about asari.
At the UNC: Depot Sigma-23 assignment, when accessing Major Flores' terminal, and after playing the third entry, Ash jokes that the rachni need to come with warning labels. Ashley may also express ignorance of the Cerberus organization.
On Feros, when Gavin Hossle describes the danger in recovering his data, Ashley deadpans: "Deadly for him, fine for us. What could be better?"
Talk to Squadmate[]
There are certain areas where if you talk to Ashley, she will offer her opinion.

On the Citadel:
At the Citadel Tower:
Ashley confides to Shepard: "So this is where the Council passes judgment on all us little folk, huh? Ever get the feeling we're in over our heads, Commander?"

She may also ask if those trees she's seeing are cherry trees.
At the Presidium:
Ashley claims she can't tell aliens from animals.
She wonders if anyone ever drowned in the artificial lake.
Ash professes distrust at the "perfection" of the place, as if something is being concealed.
Near the Krogan Monument, Ashley observes it's hard to believe the krogan were once saviors of the galaxy.
Ashley takes a liking to the Relay Monument despite being generally unimpressed with art.
In Flux:
Ashley offers to show off her dance moves to a male Shepard had they been off-duty at the time.
Ash thinks her sisters would love the place and plans to bring them to Flux for a girls' night out if she's talking to a female Shepard.
Ash wryly comments at the view on Chora's Den: "A million light years from where humanity began only to find a bar filled with men drooling over half-naked women shaking their asses on stage. I can't decide whether that's funny or sad." If Kaidan is talked to first, she jokingly responds Kaidan's "view": "Hey, Lieutenant? Put your tongue back in your mouth before you trip on it"
On Dock 422, Ashley Williams will say "This is quite the view Commander." If with a male Shepard, Ashley will say a bit more "It's so peaceful up here. Very romantic... if you're into that sort of thing."
Spontaneous[]
Sometimes Ashley will say something spontaneously, without being prompted.

On the Citadel:
When approaching the keeper on the Presidium by the foot of the Citadel Tower, Ashley exclaims "Look at that bug thing over there. What's it doing?"

During the mission to Therum:
While coming up to the outpost, Ashley will say "This route's a no-go. They have height and cover."
Before entering the elevator in the Prothean Ruins, Ashley will say "Dare you to spit over the side."
At the top of the second elevator inside the Prothean Ruins, Ashley will note "Protheans built to last. Looks like a lava flow poured in here."
During the assignment UNC: Lost Module in Eletania, if a  Space Monkey is killed instead of searched, Ashley opines she would've just thrown a rock at it.

On the shuttle ride down to the planet, Ashley will remark on how a lot of good people were lost when Saren attacked. She will then say "No kidding. I remember, I'd lost most of the 212. I was running for cover, under fire from the geth. Man, a few hostile geth look pretty reasonable compared to what we're fighting these days."
When Liara discovers the living Prothean, Ashley asks "You mean like those bodies we found back on Ilos?"
When Liara says that the Protheans uplifted species to join the galactic community, Ashley states "Uplifted? You mean like when the salarians brought the krogan out of the Stone Age?"

On the shuttle, at Liara's reminiscence of her mother, Ashley will note that Benezia was able to break free of the indoctrination when the squad needed it the most.
At the entrance to the temple, Ashley notes that military-level encryption is a little excessive for "a church."
When Liara expresses disbelief that the asari would hide a Prothean beacon, Ashley points out that the temple goes back thousands of years and that even a few breakthroughs made using the beacon's knowledge would put the asari on top of the galactic hierarchy.
Upon interacting with the Prothean VI hidden in the temple and hearing its intent to shut down, Ashley will exclaim "Wait a second!"
When Vendetta explains that a "splinter group" argued to control rather than destroy the Reapers in the Prothean era, Ashley comments that history is "repeating itself."

Guard: "Uh...I'm flattered, ma'am. Also married."
Ashley: "Hi. Ashley Williams. Office of Special Tactics and Reconnaissance. I'm looking for the best. Are you the best?"
Guard: Did I hear you right? You want me to join the Spectres?"
Ashley: "Go ahead. Feel my muscle. No, it's okay. Solid steel."

Ashley: "So he said he just wanted to be friends, and I said, 'Are you breaking up with me?'."

During Citadel Docks: Retake the Normandy:

If Ashley puts Brooks down with a shot to the back, she will say with satisfaction that she was hoping she would get to do that.
