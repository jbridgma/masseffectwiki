Kian Louros is an asari customer service representative for Sirta Foundation in the Zakera Ward. She is responsible for returns, exchanges, and group rates. Though happy at having employment, Louros doesn't understand why a human company would hire asari exclusively for their stores. Commander Shepard can talk Louros into providing a discount at the store.
