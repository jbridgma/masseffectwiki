Garka is a male batarian on Omega. He works for Aria T'Loak as an enforcer of her rule on Omega, and can be seen standing guard in her private box in the club Afterlife. 







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




Like most of Aria's guards, Garka briefly points a gun at Shepard when the Commander visits Aria for the first time. He then holsters his M-4 Shuriken and scans Shepard with his omni-tool to ensure that it is not anyone else posing as the Commander. He continues doing so even if Shepard objects and physically threatens him, but finally informs Aria and stands aside when his scans report Shepard's clean. Following Aria's threat regarding Omega's one rule, if Shepard claims they like it Aria vows Garka will remind them if they forget. The batarian adds he'll then toss the Commander's sorry ass out the airlock.
If Shepard returns a datapad retrieved while recruiting Archangel, Aria flings the datapad in Garka's face and questions how the information that the datapad held slipped their intelligence. He stutters and replies that he will look into it.
