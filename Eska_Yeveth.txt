Eska Yeveth is the Steward of Techiix. She can be found at the darkened infirmary near the hangar.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Background[]
Eska lived on Techiix her entire life, and is content to be there. She dismisses Aya's appeal, finding the lush world's air too sulfurous for her preferences.

Mass Effect: Andromeda[]
Eska receives Pathfinder Ryder slightly differently depending on when they first meet. If Ryder already rescued Buxil's brother, she extends cordial greetings in gratitude. Otherwise, she's suprised as she never expected visitors from "far away" in her daar. If Ryder complains about the cold, she chuckles and explains the angara can tolerate such temperatures, recommending the use of Techiix's sun lamps. If Ryder returns the greeting formally, Eska replies there are no strangers, only unmet friends.
The steward can tell the Pathfinder some things about the daar as well as what her job entails.
If the Ancient AI from Ja Niihk has been dealt with, Eska invites Ryder to establish an outpost on Voeld.
