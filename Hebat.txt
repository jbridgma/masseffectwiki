Description[]
Hebat is a methane-ammonia ice giant. When Heavy Metals ExoMining of China won the bidding rights to develop the moon of Presrop in the Century system, it began by establishing [sic] helium-3 refueling facility on Hebat. The station, completed this year, is considered a model facility by the executives of the state-run company. Though the station produces more than enough fuel to supply the HMEC ships running to and from Century, it has a crew of only a dozen for maintenance and oversight. Nearly all the day-to-day operations are automated.
