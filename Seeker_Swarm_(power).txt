Player Notes[]
Seeker Swarm has multiple functions: it can be used to detonate Biotic Explosions on enemies primed by Dark Channel or Dark Sphere; it can be used to deal damage over time and reduce movement speed; and, with the Damage Reduction evolution, it can act as an armor ability mitigating a maximum of 30 (40 with rank 6 Swarm Count) percent of damage.
This power behaves in a similar manner to the Volus Adept's Biotic Orbs or the Geth Juggernaut Soldier's Siege Pulse: when the power is first activated, the cooldown applies, but the swarms can be thrown in succession without triggering a cooldown. Unused Seeker Swarms will orbit around the Awakened Collector Adept.
Summoning more Seeker Swarms can only be done once all previously-summoned Seeker Swarms have been used.
It is advisable to refill your reserve of Seeker Swarms only during breaks between waves or when away from the fighting for two reasons:
The animation for summoning Seeker Swarms will cause you to pause for a few moments, allowing enemies time to attack.
The summoning animation will also cause you to move out of cover temporarily (standing up when behind low cover and standing to the side when behind high cover), potentially exposing you to enemy fire.
Similar to powers like Throw, Seeker Swarm can be used to cause a Guardian to hold its shield away from its body temporarily.
