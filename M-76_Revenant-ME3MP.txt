Description[]
Unleashes a storm of deadly high-velocity slugs. Less accurate than an assault rifle, but has a high ammo capacity and deals much more damage. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Vindicator Battle Rifle.
This custom-made machine gun features technology not widely available. Protected against replication by sophisticated Fabrication Rights Management (FRM) technology, only the richest and most powerful warlords can afford this weapon.

Acquisition[]
The M-76 Revenant is only usable by Commander Shepard if Shepard is of the Soldier class and chooses it during the Collector Ship mission.
Note:  This weapon is exclusive to Shepard (and certain unique enemies); squadmates may not use it.

Player Notes[]
The Assault Rifle Accuracy (Targeting VI) upgrade mitigates the main weakness of the Revenant and transforms it into an absolutely lethal tool. However, burst firing should still be used at medium to long range.
If firing the Revenant on fully automatic at close quarters, aim at the feet or legs – muzzle climb causes the reticule to travel up the enemy's body. The player can also mitigate the Revenant's muzzle climb by slowly and continually lowering their aim to compensate.
The M-76 has a lower damage multiplier against shields and barriers than against armor.
The Revenant possesses the largest magazine and spare ammo capacity of any assault rifle which complements its role as a sustained damage (as opposed to a burst damage) weapon. The Revenant excels at taking down large, powerful, armored enemy types with a lot of hitpoints such as Scions, Harbinger, YMIR mechs, or gunships. Running out of ammo should almost never be a concern.
Adrenaline Rush negates recoil, allowing the player to fire with no muzzle climb.
Hardened Adrenaline Rush is generally better for semi-automatic/automatic weapons such as the Revenant (see the Adrenaline Rush page for more info). It also provides a health buff that enables Shepard to take more return fire before having to retreat to cover.
Shock Trooper is the recommended evolution to Combat Mastery as it provides one more valuable second to the duration of Adrenaline Rush plus a health buff that increases the amount of return fire Shepard can sustain before having to return to cover.
Adrenaline Rush tends to benefit "burst damage" weapons more than sustained fire weapons such as the Revenant. Players may find it better to combine the Revenant with other powers such as Energy Drain, Reave, or Stasis that help with tanking through or suppressing enemy return fire.

Description[]
The M-76 Revenant unleashes a storm of deadly high-velocity slugs. It has low accuracy but a high thermal clip capacity, and packs considerable firepower. This custom-made machine gun features technology not widely available. Protected against replication by sophisticated Fabrication Rights Management (FRM) technology, only the richest and most powerful warlords can afford the Revenant.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
The M-76 Revenant can be found during the mission Priority: The Citadel II, inside the C-Sec locker room's bathroom. The bathroom is on the left side of the room with the activated fire sprinklers. It is also purchasable from Kassa Fabrication post-mission if it was missed.

Multiplayer
Weapons are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The M-76 Revenant is categorized as rare and requires no multiplayer expansion packs.

Player Notes[]
GeneralSingle-playerMultiplayer 
General
The Revenant functions in a similar manner as it did in Mass Effect 2, but it carries 20 fewer rounds per thermal clip, reloads slower, has substantially reduced accuracy, and it has even harsher recoil.
The M-76 Revenant has one of the highest capacities of all assault rifles, exceeded only by the Geth Pulse Rifle and N7 Typhoon. This makes the Revenant great at laying down suppressive fire and dealing with large groups of enemies. It definitely lends itself to the "spray and pray" method of combat. The Revenant also carries a good amount of spare ammunition.
The Revenant slows its wielder's movement when fired, though certain multiplayer classes and single-player NPC squad members are exempt from this penalty.
The Revenant has extremely high recoil and crosshair bloom. It is also not that accurate even by default unless the player aims down sights (zooms), which exacerbates the stability problem. This makes the weapon difficult to use without cover, or in long-range engagements. To counter this, employ an Assault Rifle Stability Damper mod, focus on being in cover, and fire in controlled bursts at more distant targets.
You can hit medium to long range targets if you can compensate for the recoil while firing by pulling your aim down. Combining this with a scope mod and firing from cover can make the Revenant a surprisingly accurate and stable weapon.
The Revenant has a fairly long reload time. A Soldier can mitigate this problem with a well-timed Adrenaline Rush to reload instantly. Performing a reload-cancel is also advised.
The Revenant can't penetrate objects like Guardian shields or enemy armor plating by default, so ammo modification or piercing mods must be equipped; this will usually result in a steep damage penalty.
Marksman is very effective with high capacity automatic weapons like the Revenant, increasing damage and accuracy; however, muzzle climb is made even more severe.
The N7 Hurricane deals more damage than the Revenant at less than half the Revenant's weight, and it is only somewhat harder to control.
The N7 Typhoon is considerably heavier than the Revenant, but it is superior in almost every conceivable way and without slowing movement speed. The Revenant does have an advantage over the Typhoon in that there is no damage potential lost when firing shorter bursts, as the Revenant has no need to "spin up".
Single-player
The Revenant is a good weapon for squadmates, as they will actually take advantage of the Revenant's full rate of fire unlike with many other weapons. Additionally, they are exempt from the movement penalty, weight, recoil, and crosshair bloom of the weapon. However, the N7 Typhoon is a superior option for squad members in almost every way.
Multiplayer
Firing the Revenant slows most classes in multiplayer. Drell and vorcha classes are slowed the most, while krogan and batarian classes are only marginally slowed. The Geth Juggernaut Soldier, Krogan Warlord Sentinel, N7 Destroyer Soldier, and all volus classes are exempt from the movement penalty.
Marksman mitigates the weapon's accuracy issues and also allows for an automatic reload. The Turian Soldier class excels with this weapon.
The Revenant also has a faster rate of fire than most other assault rifles, and does more damage per round than most full-auto assault rifles (in fact the only full-auto assault rifles that beat it are the Cerberus Harrier and Striker Assault Rifle, although the Striker is a bit of a special case). This makes it very capable of shredding enemies at close to medium range.
The N7 Destroyer Soldier's Devastator Mode improves weapon accuracy (especially with the rank 4 accuracy bonus) which greatly reduces the primary detriment of high recoil with the Revenant.

Description[]
Rare and expensive in the Milky Way galaxy--the preference of warlords over soldiers--the high-capacity Revenant was studied and illegally duplicated by Andromeda Initiative engineers. Though inaccurate, the fully automatic rifle can obliterate foes with a sustained barrage.

Features[]
The Revenant gained improvements to damage, clip size and reload time in the very last multiplayer update. Its reload speed is now 2.1 seconds from 2.5 seconds.

Strategies[]
SingleplayerMultiplayer
Singleplayer
Combined with a Beam Emitter augmentation, the Revenant turns into an armor destroyer. This combination is excellent option for taking down Destroyers, Fiends, and Hydras.
Multiplayer
The Revenant is stable and accurate enough to take down floating units from a distance, benefiting from Concussive and Siphon variant bonuses when applicable.

Trivia[]
A revenant is a spirit or corpse brought back from the dead.
There is an M-76 Revenant in Morinth's apartment on the wall, from which you can pick up an assault rifle upgrade.
The Revenant is occasionally used by generic Blue Suns Commanders, including 'named' Blue Suns NPCs like Warden Kuril and Jentha. It is also carried by some of Aria's henchmen, Geth Primes and the Shadow Broker.
Due to a graphical glitch, Shepard's hand clips through the weapon's grip in cutscenes, since it does not match the standard assault rifle pattern.
Although the Revenant is easily the largest assault rifle in the game, the Revenant which appears in the Normandy SR-2's armory after the weapon's acquisition appears to be significantly smaller than the actual weapon, especially compared to the M-8 Avenger and M-15 Vindicator rifles lying next to it.
The Revenant has two safety switches on the side of the gun; there is text above each one, reading "Lock" and "Load".
On BioWare's official site, the reveal trailer for Zaeed shows him using the Revenant even though he cannot in the game.
Mass Effect: Andromeda doesn't use the M-76 designation that prior Mass Effect games use for this assault rifle.
