Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II

Prerequisite: Arrae: Ex-Cerberus Scientists

You can acquire this mission either by talking to the salarian doctor at the Lab Services in Huerta Memorial Hospital (or simply hearing him speak to someone else), or by finding the poison directly.

Walkthrough[]

The poison is on a microscope at the control center of the Gellix facility staffed by ex-Cerberus. You can see it to the left as you ascend the stairs leading to the main room, near where Brynn Cole and Dr. Fredricks hold their initial conversation. Select the microscope to take it.
After finding the poison give it to the doctor in the Examination Rooms section of Huerta Memorial. He and his colleagues will use it to come up with an antidote. Upon completion, you will gain 5 Reputation, 30 experience and 1,000 credits. The Turian Sixth Fleet War Asset is also updated.
If you didn't find the poison during the mission it will be available for 1,000 credits in the Spectre Requisitions store.
Upon completion of the mission, the turian patient (identified as General Korilius) is reported to be awake and responsive the next time you pass within hearing range of the salarian doctor.
