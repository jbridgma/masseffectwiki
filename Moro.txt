Description[]
Veles has a thin atmosphere of xenon and krypton – most other materials have frozen and fallen as snow. Its surface is composed of potassium with deposits of magnesium. While investigating the primitive anaerobic life of Veles, Binary Helix survey teams discovered a cunningly hidden anchorage of the ancient krogan warlord Moro. Many records and artifacts of the Krogan Rebellions were recovered and sold at auction. The empty base is now abandoned.

Survey Text[]
