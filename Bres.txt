Description[]
Mass Effect 2[]
A member of the Fomor Belt, Bres is a dwarf planet with no atmosphere. It is, however, rich in lithium, which is integral to the heat sinks of starships and hand-held weapons. A large robo-mining operation from Caleston can be found here.

Mass Effect 3[]
A member of the Fomor Belt, Bres is a dwarf planet with no atmosphere. It is, however, rich in lithium, which is integral to the heat sinks of many starships and handheld weapons. A large robo-mining operation from Caleston once existed here, but the miners quickly abandoned the area when they learned they were in the path of the Reapers.
