Making Kadara great again isn't a straightforward task of just turning the world habitable. You also have to play nice with the local significant factions or personalities by doing some jobs for them. The Outcasts and the Collective are gearing up for a confrontation, and near the end you will have to fully side with one faction in order to get their approval for an Initiative settlement on Kadara.
