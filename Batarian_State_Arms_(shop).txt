Batarian State Arms is a store run by its namesake manufacturer in the Docks: Holding Area on the Citadel. It is located in Cargo Hold: C, the section of the docks populated by batarian refugees.
Note: The M-25 Hornet is available for purchase via the Procurement Interface on the Normandy before Priority: The Citadel II, the mission it is found in.
Note: The Kestrel Helmet becomes available at the store only if the batarian fleet was also secured in Citadel: Batarian Codes. If you killed Ka'hairal Balak or let Jordan Noles take the nameless batarian away without comment, the helmet will not appear at the store.
