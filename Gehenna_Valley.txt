Gehenna Valley is a narrow strip of land on Elaaden surrounded by steep cliffs on one side and pillars of hoodoos on the other. It is bounded by Languish to the north, Scavenger Flophouse ("Misery") to the west, steep white cliffs to the south and Paradise Sands to the east.
Persistent scavenger activity in the valley is contained at two small encampments, with one merely a few dozen meters away from the only Forward Station in the area and the eastern bounds of the flophouse.
The valley has two basic mining zones rich in element zero, graphite, and iron. Shade in the area lies mainly in the shadows generated by the giant cliffs and rocks, and while there are a few trees here they aren't enough to protect against the omnipresent heat hazard.
