The Sawtooth Plateau is an elevated region southwest of Prodromos. North of it is the expanse of the Presson Dunes and it can be reached from Outland Spire on its east via a ramping vehicle trail that ends in a distinctive four-pillar giant rock formation.
The area is named by Grace Lito due to the numerous Remnant structures jutting out of the plateau; "broken pieces like a dragon's jaw." Local wildlife include creepers tending to the Remnant structures. There are two basic mining zones in the plateau, both potentially yielding rich amounts of aluminum, graphite, iron, and vanadium. There is also one Forward Station site among the greatest concentration of Remnant ruins.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The "independent nation" Advent has a small outpost on the plateau, where they seek to drill for natural gas instead of water because doing the latter will harm their settlement. However, any sort of drilling on the plateau results in the activation of an Architect, which Pathfinder Ryder must then defeat around the concentration of Remnant ruins.
The kett occasionally send dropships to deploy troops around the flat and featureless sands. Should Ryder eliminate their stronghold at The Sheartop nearby, the reinforcements cease.
