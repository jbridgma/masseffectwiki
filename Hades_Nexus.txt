The Hades Nexus lies in the outer reaches of the Attican Traverse, by the edge of the galaxy and bordering on geth territory.
Several Prothean oddities and extinct civilization remnants can be found in the desolate but resource-rich worlds of this cluster. The asari appear to have charted many of its systems first, though humans have staked numerous mining, manufacturing, and colonial interests.

Trivia[]
The cluster is most likely named after Hades, the Greek god of the underworld and wealth.
The background for the Hades Nexus appears to be a color-corrected picture of the Orion Nebula, flipped upside down.
Downloading the Firewalker Pack renders the star chart from the Baria Frontiers store obsolete. However, completion of Project Firewalker: Volcano Station prior to Horizon only unlocks Hekate, Pamyat and Hoplos systems. The Sheol system unlocks only after Horizon is completed.
