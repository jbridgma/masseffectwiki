Appearances
Mass Effect: Andromeda


Jezra is the proprietor of the Jezra's Acquisitions store on Port Meridian. Hoping to profit off the newly defrosted colonists, she sells standard Andromeda Initiative armors. 







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Jezra was formerly an exile, and it shows in her less optimistic demeanor compared to other Meridian staff. When Pathfinder Ryder established a new status quo on the Heleus Cluster, she moved back in with the Initiative. Though she believes in the Pathfinder, she warns them not to fuck up what they've accomplished.
