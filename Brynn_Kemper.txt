Pathfinder,

We have a situation at the outpost here on Voeld. Please rendezvous with me so we can discuss the issue.

Thanks.

Leader, Outpost Taerve Uni


Walkthrough[]
Visit Priya Blake[]
Head to Taerve Uni on Voeld and speak to Priya. Some drill technicians, led by Ella Menkov, have gone missing on a research expedition to the west, and they are not responding over comm.
The team sent by Priya Blake is composed of:

Ella Menkov - Human Leader
Oliver Dane - Turian drill technician
Mesgen Thomas - Human drill technician
Brynn Kemper - Human geologist
Blake asks Ryder to find them.

Go to navpoint of final transmission[]
East-northeast of the Eroesk ruins in a deep ravine is the navpoint. At the navpoint, there is a crashed vehicle.

Search area for clues[]
The vehicle obviously has collided with an eiroch, now dead on the ground. Also on the ground are the corpses of some of the missing crew. The causes of death are electrical shock and internal damage caused by a long-range Remnant weaponry. There is a datapad nearby with a log.




Audio Dictation Log: Ella Menkov
We're nearing the sample site. Seismic activity seems unusual, but we have a lot to learn about this planet.
>>>
Entering the valley. This doesn't seem normal. Brynn, you're sure this is safe?
>>>
We've passed several eirochs, but they're all running away from the valley. I don't like this. Mesgen, let's turn back.

Shaking's getting worse. This activity is off the charts. We're coming up to the--what the hell is that? Its--

Mesgen, turn around! Go, go!

Oliver's hit! It's shooting right through the hull--go faster! I don't care!

Oh god, Oliver's not going to make it. Keep driving! We have to get back to the--

The datapad also has a navpoint.

Follow scientists' planned path[]
The navpoint leads to a large camp to the southeast of the crashed shuttle, where there is an Architect hovering overhead.

Defeat Remnant Architect[]
Take down the Architect[]
This fight is a little tougher than the other Architects because it takes place in extreme cold (Hazard Level 2). The buildings and platforms have solar heaters, so make use of them.
Defeating the Architect is a four phase fight: destroy the three leg conduits and finally the head conduit.
The Architect has devastating weapons so keep moving to avoid getting hit. The Architect also spawns Remnant forces in waves. 
Refer to the Architect page here for detailed tactics on taking down this impressive enemy.
You receive +2660 XP for beating the Architect.

Interface with the Architect[]
You receive +400 AVP  and +10% Voeld viability.
Warning:  You MUST interact with the Architect container now as leaving will cause the container to disappear and the items will be lost. [1]
Looting the Architect container yields the following:

A Remnant data core for Task: Remnant Data Cores
Fusion Mod of Hovering
Random Augmentations
Random High Value Salvage
Random Rare Minerals and Materials
Speak to Priya Blake[]
Scouts have already informed Blake of your encounter with the Architect. She feels that she failed the science team by sending them out so far but at least her people are safe now.

Aftermath[]
The defeated Architect is floating in Voeld's atmosphere: "Architect Husk: Voeld". It can be looted from the Tempest using the Galaxy Map (+50 ).

Rewards[]
+1330 XP
