Description[]
Nightmare armor is worn by Cerberus Phantoms expecting long-range conflicts. Powerful capacitors deliver punishing energy to the Phantom's weapons, and circulating coolant in its gloves allows for more shots before a given thermal clip overheats. The remaining energy focuses on shield strength and regeneration time to help survivability.

Acquisition[]
With Mass Effect 3: Citadel installed, achieve over 9,999 points in the Armax Arsenal Arena. The armor will be offered as a reward in an email, along with the Cerberus Shade Armor and Cerberus Spirit Armor. After the email is read, the armor will be located next to the machines for the bronze, silver and gold tokens. Only one armor set can be chosen, and this choice carries across additional playthroughs with the same character.
The item has an accompanying e-mail message for confirmation of availability. 




Thanks for breaking the scoreboardFrom: AAA Information Technology Dept.

Commander Shepard,

When I heard you broke the scoreboard, I thought you had discovered another bug. But I watched the replay of your fight and I was left awestruck. In testing, we had a team of krogan battlemasters trying to reach 10,000 points, but they never could. Somehow you did it. It'll take a while for us to rewrite our systems to support higher scores, but it was worth it to see someone do the impossible.

I spoke with our management to try to provide you with some merchandise--it turns out we weren't budgeted for it this year, but we actually had some suits of armor captured during the attack on the Citadel. Research and Design are done with them, and now they need a good home. What would you say to a Cerberus Phantom's armor?

Thanks for playing, Commander. We hope you had as much fun we did.

Player Notes[]
This armor is arguably the best weapons-focused Soldier/Infiltrator/Vanguard set in the game when initially available due to the Shield, Weapon Damage, Headshot Damage and Ammo boosts given.
The N7 Defender Armor and Cerberus Assault Armor sets are rendered obsolete: whereas a 10%/20% Health Boost (respectively) are their only advantage, the Nightmare offers equal or greater Weapon Damage, Ammo Capacity, and Shields, and grants Shield Regen Speed and Headshot Damage (which they both lack).
The Cerberus Ajax Armor, Cerberus Nightmare Armor, Cerberus Shade Armor and Cerberus Spirit Armor armors sets. Their combined bonuses total 80%, while most full-body armors offer 60% bonuses, and individual armor pieces give a maximum of 65%.
The fastest way to get this armor is to set the Combat Difficulty on Narrative. You still get the same amount of Score Points.
Trivia[]
The male version of this armor is identical to Kai Leng's outfit, except he does not wear a helmet. It is also used by the N7 Slayer Vanguard, though with N7 colors and logos, in multiplayer. The female version is identical to that of N7 Shadow Infiltrators.
This armor is identical in appearance to its counterparts, the Cerberus Shade Armor and the Cerberus Spirit Armor. In Mass Effect Legendary Edition all three sets differ slightly in appearance from the original game, most notably by having dark-colored face shields as opposed to gold.
