The klixen are an insectoid species resembling crabs or beetles that are encountered in Mass Effect 2. They bear a resemblance to the rachni but are clearly a different species. Klixen are usually—if not always—found with larger flying creatures called harvesters. Klixen do not appear to use weapons, and are likely not sapient. They have fire breathing capabilities and explode violently when killed, causing splash damage. They are found on the krogan homeworld Tuchanka and a few exploration sites as enemies.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Klixen may move slowly, but they become dangerous foes at melee range. Their fire-breathing attack can stagger the player, and their corpses will explode violently after they die. If killed while frozen, they will simply thaw before exploding. Like Husks, they will attempt to overwhelm their prey with numbers.

Defensive
Klixen do not possess armor on lower difficulty levels, but they compensate with high health and heavy resistance to fire from all sources; they also do not panic from burning effects.

Tactics[]
The recommended strategy is to strip their armor (on high difficulties) and disable them from afar with concussive, cryogenic, or biotic attacks.
Singularity can slow packs of these creatures if your squad ends up being overwhelmed. Stasis can stop even armored Klixen and ragdoll them briefly after it wears off. Reave is highly effective against both their armor and health, and it stuns them briefly if used against their health. Flashbang Grenade can also stun unprotected Klixen.
Stay on the move against Klixen as they are fairly slow. Do not attempt to engage them in melee as their fire breath does VERY high damage especially against targets that don't move, plus they explode on death.
Shredder Ammo, Warp Ammo, and Armor Piercing Ammo help kill Klixen quickly, especially when used against Klixen that are frozen or suspended by biotics like Pull, but be careful of their death explosion if a Klixen floats towards you.
A single Warp or Incinerate attack will usually remove what armor they have on harder modes. If neither are available, Incendiary Ammo can be used, but their resistance to fire makes its damage negligible to their health.
In desperate situations, the M-622 Avalanche is best suited for emergency heavy weapon support, quickly stripping any armor they may have and freezing them for about 30 seconds.
Combat Drone can distract a Klixen, but usually only the one it is currently attacking, and it will die quickly to a Klixen's breath. Explosive Drone can therefore be reasonably effective against packed groups of them.
Avoid using the Arc Projector against Klixen, as they are totally immune to its usual stopping and stunning effects, and the weapon deals relatively poor damage to red health bars.
Even though a Klixen's fire breath leaves a burning aftereffect on the player and allies, this is purely visual and there is no damage over time from the attack.
