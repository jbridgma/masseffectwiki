Vasilis Kostas is a cut character that would have been present in Mass Effect during the deleted assignment Global Plot 1. He would have asked Commander Shepard on the Citadel to find his missing brother Lysander.
Vasilis Kostas was raised as a test subject for the biotics company Nexxus along with his brother, Lysander, making them both "Voids" as they came to be known. Lysander would later claim Vasilis enjoyed the tests and the power the implants provided. At one point however, Lysander escaped with other test subjects, while Vasilis stayed and would eventually come to work for Nexxus as head of security. Since then, while Lysander has been gathering evidence to take down Nexxus, Vasilis has worked to find and capture his brother and destroy his data. During the events of the game, Vasilis is said to be in charge of a thousand men.[1]
Right after Shepard has dealt with Lucan in the Citadel Wards, Vasilis approaches and presents himself. He claims he got curious when he heard mention of his brother's name. Vasilis explains that his brother has been abducted by a group called Voids, which is why he was spying on Lucan. He eventually suggests to search for him on Feros. He stays on the Citadel if Shepard declines, until Shepard accepts and proceeds with the assignment. If questioned about his work, Vasilis would hesitantly say he's a researcher on the Citadel who spends most of his time looking for his brother.[2]
After having gone to Feros and met Horace, Shepard gets a transmission from Vasilis on the SSV Normandy, claiming he's on his way to Feros and asking what Shepard found. After being told the trail continues on Noveria, he insists that Shepard goes there.[3]
Within the abandoned MindTech office of Noveria, Gregor tells Shepard the truth about Vasilis. Realizing that Vasilis must have intercepted a transmission that pinpoints Lysander's location, he urges Shepard to accompany him to their hideout, a facility in the mountains. On the way, they realize Vasilis's men have already stormed the facility.[4]
Inside the facility, Vasilis appears on a holoscreen and seems surprised to learn Shepard is actually a Spectre. Nonetheless he forces Shepard to choose between chasing after him, or saving Lysander's trapped friends.[5] In either case, he is eventually seen again face-to-face, having either destroyed Lysander's incriminating data or not, depending on Shepard's actions. If it was destroyed, Lysander will suggest ripping it from Vasilis's mind, which he remarks is like torture. Shepard may agree to it, weaken Vasilis to incapacitation, and leave his fate in Lysander's hands.[6] In every case, Shepard may also decide to kill Vasilis for any reason, or by trying to arrest him. Alternatively, Shepard may also take Vasilis's offer to let him leave in exchange for credits and biotics upgrades. In this case, after disposing of Lysander, Vasilis rewards Shepard as promised and explains that despite having to erase evidence and the sizable portion of his security force Shepard killed, he should be able to make it even stronger thanks to the data he found. He has Shepard escorted back to Port Hanshan and says he hopes they never meet again.[7]
