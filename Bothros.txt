Description[]
A rock and ice planet, Bothros is home to a scientific curiosity. Evidence of a primate-like spacefaring civilization was found frozen in its equatorial ice, ranging from melted fragments of metal to preserved remains of the creatures still wearing suits for extra-vehicular activity. Further exploration revealed that their habitation centers were vaporized by orbital bombardments from railgun-like weapons hitting with a force of approximately 120 kilotons of TNT. Only those that fled or happened to be away from the habitats were preserved in the ice, where they died of asphyxiation.
This unknown species did not come from Asteria, but scientific teams are looking for evidence that they visited there. It is difficult to believe they would colonize a frozen rock like Bothros and ignore a lush garden world. Their world of origin is also a mystery.
ALLIANCE BULLETIN: Geth have been encountered in the Hekate system. All civilian traffic is prohibited.

Trivia[]
Bothros is an Ancient Greek word that means "hole", "pit", or "trench".
The planet in the same system which the Bothros description refers to, Asteria, is not present in Mass Effect 2. This is fixed in Mass Effect 3 where Asteria does exist.
