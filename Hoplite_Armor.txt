(Hidden manufacturer only accessible with the PC Cheats using the PC Console).
The operatives of Cerberus produce their own specialist hardware for black ops wetwork. Their weapons are advanced particle beams with excellent shield penetration, damage, and accuracy. Their field hardsuits feature advanced protective measures and sophisticated anti-hacking measures.
The armor line of this manufacturer offers the best tech/biotic protection on all races and levels. Since this is not normally attainable in the game, the actual distinction goes to the runner-up Predator L/M/H Armors of Armax Arsenal.

Trivia[]
This is likely a reference to the Skunk Works, which is the 'official alias' of Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs, a division known for its development of cutting-edge technology for the United States Military.
The weapons are likely named after Greek mythological creatures, while the Hoplite armor is likely named after the common soldiers of the same name in ancient Greece.
