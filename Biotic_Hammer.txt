Player Notes[]
Though not listed in the power description text, Biotic Hammer can hit up to 3 targets in a very small area of effect.
Biotic Hammer can detonate all four types of Power Combos. If the Fire Damage or Chill evolutions are selected for Electrical Hammer, the Krogan Warlord becomes capable of setting-up and detonating its own Fire Explosions or Cryo Explosions by using Biotic Hammer as the detonator power. Use of weapons equipped with Disruptor/Incendiary Rounds to prime targets is also an effective way to increase Biotic Hammer's damage and area of effect.
Biotic teammates with powers such as Warp, Reave, and Singularity are needed for the Warlord to take advantage of the Biotic Combos evolution.
