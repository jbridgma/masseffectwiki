Description[]
Nephros (which means "restless sleep") is a relatively small hydrogen-nitrogen gas giant. Its atmosphere is home to spectacular winds of up to 350 kilometers/hour and electrical systems up to 700 times the power of those on Earth, which indicate that its hydrogen clouds contain moderate amounts of water vapor.
