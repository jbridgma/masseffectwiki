Description[]
Hunsalra is a small hydrogen-helium gas giant. It has unusually large amounts of nitrogen in the upper atmosphere, which glow purple when ionized by the solar wind. Hunsalra's convenience as a place to dump drive charge has left its orbit littered with debris "dumped overboard" by visiting crews.

Properties[]
Hunsalra is too small to be a "hydrogen-helium gas giant" (William Hubbard, The New Solar System 4th ed, 1999; p. 194). It is more likely a dense "ice giant" like Neptune or Gliese 436 b.

Trivia[]
Thegeuse, the fourth planet in the Tereshkova system, has a shorter orbital period than Hunsalra (25.3 Years to 46.2 Years). This suggests a probable writing error.
