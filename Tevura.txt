Description[]
Tevura is a hydrogen-methane ice giant with a core of frozen ammonia and trace hydrocarbons.
The world is named for an ancient asari goddess of love, sex, travel, and law--spheres of influence whose overlap initially baffled human xenoanthropologists. Asari reproductive instincts are strongly exogamous, and before alien contact, their instincts sent the asari roaming outside their kinship groups to avoid mating with relatives. The journeys necessitated a system of rules governing guests, fugitives, and alliances--all watched over by the goddess Tevura.
The Reapers have ignored Tevura so far, its science stations and moon-based mining equipment offering little strategic importance. It is likely that a destroyer will eventually be sent here to exterminate any civilians.
