Walkthrough[]
Silver Coast Casino Floor[]
Brooks is required for this mission, EDI is not allowed into the casino because she's a mech/AI, so pick one of any other team mates. Since there's no shooting or fighting in this one, pick anyone you fancy, because their role is to distract the security at your call, or provide some comedic banter along the way.


Shepard and the team get the red carpet treatment upon arriving and they just smile and wave. The dialogue here will vary depending on certain factors, including Shepard's gender, who you have with you, if you're currently romancing the person you brought with you, and if you had your scars healed or left unhealed.
Once you are inside, move up the stairs and onto the casino floor. You will only have control of your other squadmate as Brooks will head directly for the shaft. Mingle with the guests for a little bit. Brooks will eventually call you up because there is a problem. Head up the stairs and to the shaft.
Tip: There are several more periods during this mission where you are waiting for Brooks to contact you to continue. If for any reason you want to speed through, saving then reloading the save should skip the waits.


Once you find Brooks, she mentions there is an alarm on the grate. Brooks gives Shepard a pair of resonance emitter lenses, provided by Liara, which allows Shepard to see and follow underground circuits. These lenses cause Shepard's eyes to appear yellow for the remainder of the mission. Also, if Shepard is an Engineer, Brooks will comment on this and your technical expertise. 
Be careful when in visual range of guards or cameras as your security threat will rise if you make it too obvious what you are doing. Follow the blue wiring. The junction box is at the other end of the upper level guarded by a camera. Liara will upload a program to bypass the camera, but once you start don’t take too long as it doesn’t last very long. Bypass the box and Brooks will get in. Since this could take a while, mingle a bit more.


After mingling a bit more, Brooks runs into another problem: there is a guard right beneath her. Distract him for a bit to allow her to pass. Shepard will tell the guard there is a red sand user in the bathroom and he will move to confront them. Brooks will radio she is clear, so back to mingling. Be careful to avoid setting things off. There are two ATMs on the ground floor you can get at for 3000 credits each and some Renegade points, but you have to bypass the respective cameras to do so.
When Brooks contacts you again, she has run into two problems. EDI and Liara come up with a solution, this time requiring you to follow red wiring. They lead to opposite sides of the casino: a terminal near the roulette tables, and another near the varren race tables. On the left is the pressure pad. You have to distract a guard and a camera. Send your squadmate to distract the guard, bypass the camera, then the security device. You have now two problems, two guards. Send your squadmate to distract one, the stationary one, and watch the patrolling one for the right moment. Be careful when you try and go, because if you get seen, you become suspected. Mingle immediately or it will be critical mission failure. 
After bypassing them both, Brooks says that she is at the panic room and will be bypassing the lock. However, she misses one of the security devices and gets caught. EDI tells Shepard that she can call the guard to tell them it is a false alarm, but you need to reach him before that happens. It is the same guard that you talked to earlier. Once that is over, Brooks will radio she is clear so get back to talking and playing games if you feel like it.


Brooks will finally radio she is in and now you need to meet her. There is one camera that you need to take care of, yellow wiring this time. This area is filled with two guards and two cameras. You can’t do anything about the patrolling guard, but you need to do something about the stationary one. Just keep an eye on the former. You have to be fast. 
Once the patrolling guard turns away from the first camera junction box, move. Send your squadmate to distract the stationary guard, then bypass the first and second boxes, while keeping an eye on the patrolling guard. Then hurry and bypass the camera box while ensuring you are out of visual range of both guards. Once you are done, you are inside.

Safe Room[]
Once inside the safe room Shepard tells Khan they are going to have a talk, except Khan can’t talk because he is dead. Brooks manages to get into the terminal, but finds a deletion order on it. Brooks starts to beat herself up but Shepard calms her and then examines the terminal for mistakes. Bingo. They wiped the terminal but not the comm. Shepard activates the comm and a face appears on the screen over the mantel, distorted beyond recognition through signal degradation. 
Follow the conversation. Eventually the figure says that they will take everything that Shepard is and everything they own. As the conversation cuts, Brooks says she couldn't trace the call. Shepard orders them to remove the drives and get them back so EDI can analyze them.

Mingle Dialogue[]
Shepard can interact with various personalities in the casino, either on a purely conversational basis or to evade the notice of patrolling guards. 

Aishwarya Ashland[]
Standing next to a turian, near the roulette tables.
On approach:
Croupier: Round and round and round she goes.
Aish: What's that supposed to mean? Is that like code for how wasted I am?
Croupier: Uh... no, ma'am. We just call the wheel "she."
Aish: That's sexism. Wait, I mean objectivism. That's sexism for inanimate things.

First conversation:
Aish: I love roulette. Every minute is more exciting than the next.
Shepard: Should I point out the flaw in that statement?
Aish: Oh, are you like one of those detail people? Come on. Even diamonds have flaws, but that doesn't make them less valuable.
Shepard: Miss, where exactly were you educated?
Aish: Oh, online. You can take these courses, and it teaches you responsibility, because you do the grading.

Second conversation:
Aish: You, tough-girl/tough-guy. Perfect. I need an opinion on something from a B-lister or below.
Aish: Houses with retractable roofs. Still in? Or too common?
Shepard: Your house has a retractable roof?
Aish: Only the one on the Citadel. I gotta take care of it since the one on Earth got all Reaperified.
Shepard: Instead of remodeling, maybe you could invite a few refugees to come stay.
Aish: Oh, I'm totally on that. But finding the right one is hard, you know? So many of them don't have agents.

Third conversation:
Aish: Can't stay away, can you?
Shepard: What can I say? I'm a masochist.
Aish: Oh, no kidding! I'm a Scorpio. We'll get along great.

Andrew[]
Conversing with a woman named Tina near Khan's security gate.
First conversation:
Andrew: The thing about salarian parties is, they all do it too well.
Shepard: I don't follow.
Andrew: My lab group on Sur'kesh, all salarians but me, all with damn-near-perfect memories.
Tina: Oh, that could get awkward.
Andrew: Exactly! It was all about who burnt the cake six months ago, or arguments that two people continue when they meet up once a year....
Shepard: So they never let anything go.
Andrew: Yeah, it was constant one-upmanship. I couldn't keep pace with them if I'd wanted to.

Second conversation:
Tina: So you don't miss Sur'kesh at all?
Andrew: Not the humidity and not the lack of privacy. But the science was like nowhere else.
Shepard: What did you work on?
Andrew: What didn't we? Food scanners for the paranoid, chemical bonders, self-cleaning mating pools...
Shepard: Learned a lot, huh?
Andrew: For the mating pools, way more than I wanted to know.

Third conversation:
Andrew: Hey again. Back for more tales out of school?
Shepard: Sure.
Tina: Andrew was just saying the salarians came up with satellites that eat orbiting debris. So their space isn't all cluttered like ours.
Shepard: Nice trick. What won't they think of next?
Andrew: Hair extensions, I imagine.

Casino Bartender[]
One on the casino main floor, another on the dance floor. Both say the same things.
On approach:
Bartender: Drinks are complimentary tonight, ma'am/sir.

First conversation:
Bartender: What are you having?
Shepard: Nothing too crazy. I want to be able to walk a straight line.
Bartender: Thessian Temple coming up.
Shepard: Are asari drinks usually mild?
Bartender: Not all of them. Mr. Khan had us put out some gelatin shots earlier. Also asari, but they kick like a shotgun.

Second conversation:
Bartender: Evening.
Shepard: What's popular tonight?
Bartender: Well, some adventurous souls are trying the mindfish. It's what hanar like to do instead of alcohol.
Shepard: Huh. I guess since they're mostly water, the dehydration would be bad.
Bartender: Right. So there's this fish with hallucinogenic skin oil. Gets hanar buzzed right up.
Shepard: What happens if humans eat it?
Bartender: Way more potent, and it releases into our systems slowly. Best to clear your schedule for the entire weekend.

Third conversation:
Bartender: What can I do for you?
Shepard: I'm curious: What's the craziest thing you've ever served up?
Bartender: Well, there's the burukh. That's a krogan drink you set on fire, put out, then drink from the scalding-hot cup.
Bartender: There's a "Weeping Heart." That's a martini with drell-skin venom. The venom's pretty mild, though.
Bartender: Oh, wait -- a volus bina. The alcohol puts you on the floor, and the ammonia lets you clean up the mess you made. If you live.

Columbia Rios[]
She and her assistant Noah are found in a booth near the stairway to the dance floor beside the varren race terminals.
On approach:
Rios: So push my tour of the camp from one o'clock to three, move the three to five, and we'll find ten minutes to eat somewhere.

First conversation:
Assistant: So to sum up, tomorrow starts with the Help a Dream foundation, then it's blood drive, refugee camp and hospital tour.
Shepard: Huh. Sounds like you turned pro.
Rios: I try.
Assistant: Ms. Rios believes we have an obligation to the less fortunate.
Shepard: Of course. So how are you liking the party so far?
Rios: There's a party?

Second conversation:
Shepard: Rios. I feel like I should know that name...
Rios: I did a little acting, then in the seventies during the Blitz, I was named goodwill ambassador for refugees.
Shepard: So I guess this kind of thing doesn't really impress you?
Rios: Me, no. For the people who can get clothes because you bought a ticket? Much different story.

Third conversation:
Assistant: Ms. Rios, it's getting late and you have a full schedule ahead.
Rios: Don't handle me, Noah. If I reach one more person before we leave, that's a family of four who can eat tomorrow.
Shepard: Reach how?
Rios: The price of admission isn't the only help to give. If you drop some credits at the games, it goes straight to refugees.
Assistant: Have I told you today that you're beautiful, Ms. Rios?
Rios: Yes, Noah. And I presume you mean on the inside.

Elspeth Murrain[]
Would-be politician found on the other end of the bartender's table in the casino main floor.
On approach:
Murrain: No, no. I'm not running for Citadel Council. I'm running for Zakera Ward City Council.

First conversation:
Murrain: Hi, Elspeth Murrain. I'm running for Zakera Ward City Council. Are you a citizen here?
Shepard: I've... had bad experiences with politicians.
Murrain: Who hasn't? That's why I'm running--I got sick of leaders with ties to Terra Firma or Cerberus or worse.
Shepard: Oh?
Murrain: The ward needs refugee facilities. It needs security, it needs jobs, it needs everything.
Murrain: And hopefully with a friend like Elijah Khan backing me, I can make it happen.

Second conversation:
Shepard: What's your connection to Khan, exactly?
Murrain: He's a campaign contributor.
Shepard: Uh-huh. You may want to do a background check on him.
Murrain: He's dirty?
Shepard: Like you can't imagine.
Murrain: Arrgh! Not again!

Third conversation:
Murrain: can't believe this! I just got done returning donations from some Terminus pirate woman.
Shepard: Was her name Aria?
Murrain: Yeah. And before that it was an asari Spectre. Tela something. And before that, there was this krogan...
Murrain: Do I have a sign on my back saying "exploit me?"
Shepard: Well, you don't exactly come across as... formidable.
Murrain: But I'm trying to fix it! I practice glares in the mirror every night!
Shepard: Good luck, Ms. Murrain.

Jonah Ashland[]
Found drinking upstairs in the casino's dance floor.
On approach:
Jonah: You know, I respect the first guy who looked up at Saturn and said, "That thing up there, it isn't a star."
Jonah: But you gotta love the guy who said "That thing up there? That's gonna be my gas station."

First conversation:
Shepard: Enjoying the party?
Jonah: Young people party. I drink. Tonight it's ryncol on the rocks.
Shepard: That stuff can put you down for the count.
Jonah: I just lost a staggering amount of income. This puts things in perspective.
Shepard: You need a few credits for a ride home or anything?
Jonah: Oh, no, it's not like that. You know about all those helium-3 facilities that are getting wiped out?
Shepard: I've flown by a few.
Jonah: To put it in layman's terms, most of those facilities were mine.

Second conversation:
Jonah: I don't think I introduced myself. Jonah Ashland of Eldfell-Ashland Energy.
Shepard: Shepard. Pretty fancy night out for someone worried about his financial future.
Jonah: It was my daughter Aish's idea. She's got a good heart, though she's going through a little...self-absorbed stage.
Shepard: You make it sound like she's trouble. (If Jonah was talked to first before Aish)
Jonah: My love for her is unlimited. She just gives me a lot of opportunities to prove it.
Jonah: But I'm pretty sure she can change. You don't bet against something like that. Not even here.
Shepard: We've met. (If Aish was talked to first before Jonah)
Jonah: Ah. Then maybe I should pass the ryncol over to you.

Third conversation:
Jonah: Look at them all down there. Twenty years ago, you'd have never seen a shindig like this.
Jonah: Humans and turians together like it's nothing, Council species all concerned about the fate of batarians...
Jonah: ...everybody trying to have sex with the asari....
Shepard: That's not new.
Jonah: Just seeing if you were awake.
Shepard: So. All these species in one room...
Jonah: Yeah. Nobody's afraid of each other anymore. If we win this thing, the galaxy's going to be a pretty great place.
Shepard: I'll drink to that.

Lawyer[]
Found near the quasar terminals talking to someone via omni-tool.
On approach:
Lawyer: No, seriously, have you ever tried to chase an ambulance? In a skycar, it's about the most dangerous thing you can do.

First conversation:
Lawyer: I'll call you back, potential client here.
Shepard: Enjoying the party?
Lawyer: Like adrenaline in my heart. They're going to have a fire-breather on the bar later and shoot fireworks above the ward.
Shepard: Would fireworks even burn in a vacuum?
Lawyer: It worked at New Year's. Whatever they did, it looked freaking nuclear.

Second conversation:
Shepard: So are you Khan's lawyer?
Lawyer: I represented the casino once. Brutality suit.
Shepard: What's Khan like?
Lawyer: Intense. Scares the hell out of his staff. But every now and then, he does some charity like this.
Shepard: Does that make up for it?
Lawyer: If what I hear about him is true? Not remotely.

Third conversation:
Shepard: You ever think about working for someone a little more above-board?
Lawyer: Like who?
Shepard: The Council is going to need lawyers like everyone else.
Lawyer: You think I should defend the Citadel Council if they get sued?
Shepard: Who said anything about defense?
Lawyer: Hah!

Rolan Quarn[]
Barefaced turian loitering in front of the security gate to Khan's panic room.
First conversation:
Shepard: Interesting. You're not mingling and you're not betting. What's your game?
Quarn: The name's Rolan Quarn. The game, Commander Shepard, is hearts and minds.
Shepard: Care to elaborate?
Quarn: Most people in this casino are here for a good cause. Others are just here to be seen. Phonies, if you will.
Quarn: They have money they won't miss. Others, who are not myself, need it. So the honorable thing to do is to part them from this money.
Shepard: So you're a con man.
Quarn: Con men leave their marks angry. Con artists leave them smiling.

Second conversation:
Shepard: I'm debating whether I should report you to security.
Quarn: Oh, I like a good debate.
Shepard: Would you be so smug if I got you thrown out of here?
Quarn: Possibly. I'd like to see you explain my wicked motives, right after you explain why you have a radio in your ear.
Shepard: Well, since I don't see you turning me in either, I gather you're no friend of Khan's.
Quarn: Khan doesn't have friends. Anyone who says otherwise is deluding themselves.

Third conversation:
Shepard: So is Khan part of your game tonight?
Quarn: No. I simply shear-- no, what do humans call it? I fleece his guests.
Shepard: Then there's no harm in telling me what his weaknesses are.
Quarn: I've studied him. He's ruthless and rich, but not very bright. Temperamental. Doesn't deal well with the unexpected.
Quarn: He's also used to letting other people handle things he doesn't understand. Like his security.
Shepard: That's quite an assessment. Do I owe you anything?
Quarn: No. We do what we do because there are wrongs that need righting. The wrongs I address are simply pettier than yours.
Shepard: Then I guess we know where we stand, Mr. Quarn.
Quarn: Enjoy the evening, Commander.

Selyana[]
Loitering with Lihana beside a waterfall near the casino main floor bartender.
On approach:
Lihana: It's for a good cause. For every thousand you lose, that's a roof over the head of some poor human or vorcha or whatever.
Selyana: I'm all for that, but if I'm not trying to win, where's the challenge?
Lihana: In taking the house, dear. Like I always say, "Each must try to gain as much as she can, then give as much as she can."

First conversation:
Selyana: Why hello, love. Isn't the turnout amazing? I wasn't sure anyone would show up.
Shepard: We pull together when we have to.
Selyana: I feel so bad for the humans. If you need a place to stay or anything, you just let me know.
Shepard: I have a place to stay now, but thanks.
Lihana: So you had nothing before that? How brave of you to endure, dear.
Selyana: The humans are so resilient. Like that phrase of theirs: "Stiff one in the lips."
Shepard: Stiff upper lip.
Selyana: Right, of course. What did I say?

Second conversation:
Selyana: Hello again. Selyana Eranos, by the way, and this is Lihana Pirrit. We're friends of Mr. Khan.
Lihana: Hi.
Selyana: Li here encouraged him to have a charity night. She just about melted his heart.
Lihana: Mr. Khan doesn't melt. But I did show him it'd earn some good press.

Third conversation:
Selyana: I need to try that roulette table again. There's a snotty human girl I need to show up.
Lihana: Sel, by the time the night is done, you'll have bought breakfast for every batarian on the station.
Selyana: Hopefully running water instead. Have you visited their camp? The place is fragrant.
Lihana: Well, we can stop worrying about outdoing the human girl.

Sha'ira[]
Sha'ira is found near a stairway to the dance floor. 

Varren Race Gambler[]
Human near the varren race tables.
On approach:
Announcer: Attention--bets are locked. Attention! All bets are locked. Good luck, ladies and gentlemen.

First conversation:
Gambler: Come on, Tiger Bite! Bring it home!
Shepard: You got a lot riding on him?
Gambler: He's my boy. Picked him up at a shelter. Whoever let him go had no eye for racers.
Gambler: He can outrun anything he can't outfight, and outfight anything he can't outrun.
Shepard: What are the odds on him?
Gambler: Enough to pay for my kid's tuition.

Second conversation:
Shepard: So these holos aren't just holos, right? Real varren are racing somewhere?
Gambler: Oh, yeah. They set up a track. Our pups eat, they bark, they need cleaning up.
Shepard: What's a pro racer eat?
Gambler: A special diet based on what they'd get in the wild, minus the radioactive crap.
Shepard: So, what, raw krogan leg?
Gambler: Oh, man, my dogs would love that. Kind of illegal, though.

Third conversation:
Shepard: Are there a lot of fights in varren races?
Gambler: Only if something goes wrong. But I don't call my boy "Tiger Bite" for nothing.
Gambler: They throat each other. You know, they grab and hold for dominance but they don't actually break the skin.
Shepard: Sounds like quite a trick.
Gambler: Yeah, if I had teeth like that, I'd poke somebody's eye out. Evolution's a pretty amazing thing.
