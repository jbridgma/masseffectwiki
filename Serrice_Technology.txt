This article is about the shop. For the corporation, see Serrice Council.

Serrice Technology is a store on Illium that is managed by Hermia.

Discount[]
Commander Shepard can receive a discount after convincing the asari shopkeeper.
Alternatively, if Shepard is asked by Gianna Parasini to ask the shopkeeper for 'special goods', she will intervene and will instead warn her that she's being watched. Hermia will give a discount before leaving.
Note:  Doing both of the above does not result in a bigger discount. If the player initially convinces the shopkeeper to give the discount and then completes Gianna's assignment, the discount remains in place.
