Compatibilities[]
Guns - This augmentation can be applied to gun-type weapons.
Description[]
Ammo refills automatically after a delay, -60% Clip Size

Mechanics[]
The Vintage Heat Sink automatically cools down the weapon rather than using disposable thermal clips. 

The benefit of not using thermal clips is not having to reload the weapon.
An excellent additional benefit of this augmentation is that it eliminates the reload animation. This greatly increases the rate of fire of low ammo capacity weapons, such as single-shot shotguns or sniper rifles. This benefit is most noticeable with the single-shot weapons but applies to any weapons in actuality.
All weapons using the Vintage Heat Sink have a flat recharge time that is not effected by penalties or bonuses to weapon reload speed.
Note:  Despite the Gun Behavior augmentation text stating that "You may apply one such augment to a gun during the development process", both of the Gun Behavior augmentations - the Vintage Heat Sink and the Plasma Charge System - can be applied to the same item. That is because the Vintage Heat Sink is actually  set up as special augmentation in the game, and such cannot be used together with other special augments, like Bio Converter or Aerial Lubricant,
