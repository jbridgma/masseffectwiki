From: Daksa Teller

Commander Shepard,

On behalf of Elkoss Combine, I'd like to congratulate you on your recent victories in the Citadel's combat simulator arena. We could not help but notice two rarities, first the excellent quality of your performance, and second, that you have not yet settled on a corporate sponsor.

Elkoss Combine delivers the dynamic resources that the enterprising athlete needs, producing a competitive one-time liquid asset stipend to ensure you can afford the top gear. If this return-on-investment meets with your satisfaction, we have an exciting scenario planned for your Elkoss debut. Select the Spin Zone layout versus Elite enemies, and close the deal with the high-powered win we know you can deliver.

Sincerely,
Daksa Teller
Earth-Clan Talent Liaison, Elkoss Combine

Walkthrough[]
At the Combat Simulator Control terminal, select "Spin Zone" as the map and "Elite" level enemies. The Spin Zone option is a bronze level prize, and the "Elite" enemies are a silver level prize—these will need to be purchased using your prior match winnings. The other settings are your choice—because most challenges are not mutually exclusive, you could conceivably finish other arena challenges at the same time, e.g. Citadel Arena: Thermal Clip Challenge and/or Citadel Arena: Medi-Gel Challenge.
After the match is completed, check the terminal for the following e-mail:
