The tomkah is a large infantry fighting vehicle fielded by the krogan on Tuchanka. It is outwardly similar to the Alliance M35 Mako and M29 Grizzly, although it is considerably larger, standing almost twice as high as a standard Alliance IFV. The greater size is likely at least partially due to having to accommodate passengers the size of krogan as opposed to humans. Its only visible armament is a large dorsal double-barreled turret housed towards the rear of the vehicle, most likely a mass accelerator cannon. Its armor is strong enough to withstand a ten-ton bomb.
Vital to the tomkah's operation is a part called the combustion manifold. The vehicle can run without it, but mechanics are very reluctant to deploy affected vehicles out in the field. Constructing a replacement may take some three days' worth of work.

Trivia[]

The tomkah may be named after Tonka Trucks, a line of American toy construction vehicles dating back to the middle of the 20th century. The wheels on the tomkah are mammoth, in scale to the rest of the vehicle, like the Tonka trucks. Tonka is the Dakota-Sioux word for "big" or "great", which accurately describes the tomkah.
According to The Art of the Mass Effect Trilogy, the vehicle that became the tomkah in Mass Effect 2 was originally a rejected design for the M35 Mako in Mass Effect.
