Angaran Resistance fighter with bioelectric abilities, ranged damage, and combo detonations.
The Angara Exemplar has years of combat training and doesn't have much patience with these new aliens and their unconventional ways. Still, the newcomers are feet on the ground, so he'll put up with them for the greater good.
The Anagara Exemplar joins the Nexus militia forces during the Roekaar occupation APEX missions in Heleus Cluster.
