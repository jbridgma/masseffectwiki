Character present:

Jeff "Joker" Moreau

Joker: As we're flying along in this... infinite vast expanse of nothingness, passengers on the left can look out their portholes and see... nothing for miles and miles and miles, with the occasional star clusters and distant asteroid belts.

Joker: And the lucky ones on the right have the opportunity to see... an ice rock, probably never inhabited. Not surprised, it doesn't look very... friendly.

Joker: Now cross your fingers. I'm gonna turn around to take you into an incredible journey through razor-sharp asteroids. Just kidding, there's nothing there.

Joker: Now relax a bit, you can even walk freely around the deck or go to the labs if you want to work. Just don't forget to clean up after you're done, all right? Cleaning lady is having a day off.

Joker: The chef recommends dehydrated ice creams with fruits and something that was supposed to be a meat... meat loaf. It didn't cook up well.

Joker: The weather for today is cold, reaching absolute zero. It's not recommended going outside without a hat, scarf... All right, you might also need a body suit.

Joker: I've turned up the porthole heater so you could have a better view on... absolutely nothing. Have fun!

Joker: Ah, I'm bored. Anyone got any board games? I could play a couple rounds.

Joker: I'm wasting time here. I'm just sitting here with my thumb up my ass. Not literally, I always wash my hands. Want to see my nails?

Joker: It's about time for a break. Piss break I mean. Could you pass me that bottle? Just kidding, I'm going.

Joker: Do you have some sudoku? I'm about to die of boredom.

Joker: Do you have a book with crosswords? Preferably the biggest one filled with exceptionally difficult words. I'm bored.

Joker: Don't you have better things to do? Are you not a badass Spectre, saving the world and that kind of crap?

Joker: Wanna talk? Take a seat. It's not like I dislike gossip, except for the fact that I hate it.

Joker: Go save the day, old timer. I have a lot things to do. I need to pick my nose, for starters.

Joker: You need to spend more time with the crew. Not that you are bothering me, it's just... I'm feeling a bit hemmed in, okay?

Joker: What, you wanna do a high-five or a little dancing?

Joker: I would take it seriously if I didn't have a lot of work to do. What? You've got nothing to do and you just came here to see me? How cute.

Joker: You know, not many women would've looked great in those fatigues. You are the exception. That was a compliment in case you hadn't noticed.

Joker: You see, I don't want to sound too confident or anything, but would you like to go for a drink with me? Coffee? No? How about juice, you like juice? I prefer grapefruit... Wait, am I boring you? I'm not some hero, you know? But I can tell jokes for example. You know the one about a pig?

Joker: Hey, hey, nice to see you again!

Joker: Okay, fine, go away! Now! I'll stay here, alone! To save your asses if need be.

Characters present:

Commander Shepard
Jeff "Joker" Moreau
Steven Hackett

Joker: Commander, we've got a priority signal from Fifth Fleet headquarters. Patching it through.
Steven Hackett: Commander, there's a situation [(English) in the Artemis Tau cluster. / (foreign) on Artemis 13093. In its orbit, to be precise.] Terrorists seized an asteroid being moved in orbit around the colony. They're going to bring it down. We only have an hour before the rock hits the red line.

(Par) Ready and able. (Neu) Please go on. (Ren) So? Blast it away. (Inv) What's it doing there?  Shepard: We're at your disposal if you need us, Admiral.Steven Hackett: I appreciate that, Commander, but there's another factor you should be aware of. There was an engineering crew of a hundred aboard the rock. They were monitoring stability during transit. As far as we know, they're still aboard. Shepard: If you're calling us, there must be more to it than that.Steven Hackett: There was an engineering crew of a hundred aboard the rock. They were monitoring stability during transit. As far as we know, they're still aboard. Shepard: Why do you need us for? Just blow it into rubble.Steven Hackett: I have ships standing by, but the terrorists have hostages aboard. There was an engineering crew of a hundred aboard the rock. They were monitoring stability during transit. As far as we know, they're still aboard. Shepard: Why was the asteroid being moved?Steven Hackett: I think they were going to tether it to an orbital elevator, I didn't ask. All that's important to us is that a big rock is going to hit dirt in sixty.(Return to last choice)
(Par) We're on it. (Neu) What will you do? (Ren) Not worth the hassle. (Inv) Investigate  Shepard: We can try to extract them.Steven Hackett: You're our best bet, Commander. I'll send our marines from the Harare, but they're mostly greenhorns. Your best option is to gain control of the engines. The engineers installed three fusion torches to propel it from the asteroid belt into orbit. If you can get control of them in the next hour, you can change the asteroid's vector, steer it into a stable orbit around the planet. If that's impossible, see if you can get the engineers out. We'll blast the rock into rubble. If all else fails, we'll have to sacrifice the hostages. Shepard: Is there an extraction op planned?Steven Hackett: You're our best bet, Commander. I'll send our marines from the Harare, but they're mostly greenhorns. Your best option is to gain control of the engines. The engineers installed three fusion torches to propel it from the asteroid belt into orbit. If you can get control of them in the next hour, you can change the asteroid's vector, steer it into a stable orbit around the planet. If that's impossible, see if you can get the engineers out. We'll blast the rock into rubble. If all else fails, we'll have to sacrifice the hostages. Shepard: Unless there are more engineers than colonists, I'd say "weapons free."Steven Hackett: If we have no other choice, we'll do that. I hope you can give us another option. You're our best bet, Commander. I'll send our marines from the Harare, but they're mostly greenhorns. Your best option is to gain control of the engines. The engineers installed three fusion torches to propel it from the asteroid belt into orbit. If you can get control of them in the next hour, you can change the asteroid's vector, steer it into a stable orbit around the planet. If that's impossible, see if you can get the engineers out. We'll blast the rock into rubble. If all else fails, we'll have to sacrifice the hostages. [Investigate]
(Neu) Return (Inv) They may be dead already. (Inv) Evacuate the colony.  (Return to overarching choice) Shepard: Are we sure the engineers are alive?Steven Hackett: The terrorists claim they're still alive. We're holding fire until we can extract them, or confirm they're dead.(Return to last choice) Shepard: Can you evacuate the colonists? There can't be that many, the planet's still using a registry number.Steven Hackett: We couldn't do it in an hour, not with the resources we have on site. It is still a garden world, Commander. The rock's big enough to cause a climate shift. There aren't so many habitable worlds out there that we can lose one.(Return to last choice)
(Par) We'll handle it. (Neu) No promises. (Ren) I can't get distracted.  Shepard: We'll make it right, Admiral.Steven Hackett: Thank you, Commander. We'll transmit the asteroid's location and vector to your navigator. Fifth Fleet out. Shepard: I'll see if we can divert from our current mission.Steven Hackett: Anything you could do would be appreciated. We'll transmit the asteroid's location and vector to your navigator. Fifth Fleet out. Shepard: We have our own mission to worry about.Steven Hackett: I understand... No, that's a lie. I don't understand. But you're not under my command. Officially, I can only beg for favors. We'll handle it ourselves. Fifth Fleet out.

Terrorist leader: What form of life consumes more than it needs to live? Organics. We pass through the galaxy like a worm, eating everything before us, leaving only excretia behind. We must transcend! Free our spirits from these shells of meat and bone, these imperfect vessels, slaves to hormones and crippling infirmity. The day is coming when the intellect can be transfigured into data! Until that day, we must stop the organic virus from infecting more worlds!

(Par) You're insane. (Neu) You're finished. (Ren) You're dead.  Shepard: You get that crazy in college? This is murder, not philosophy class. Shepard: Are you done? Because I think you're done. Shepard: You people want to get loaded into boxes? I can help.

Shepard: Then that's where we're going. Move out, people. Shepard: Let's get this over with. Somebody needs an ass-kicking. Whoever it is, we'll find them there.

Garrus Vakarian: We weren't counting on them having armatures, Shepard. There could be more inside the mines. Maybe we should wait for backup.

(Par) There's no time! (Neu) We can handle it. (Ren) Screw the back up!  Shepard: There are people down there that need our help. Maybe they can tell us what's so important down there, and why the geth are so determined to find it. Shepard: We can take down anything they throw at us. We're going in. Shepard: The geth wouldn't send an armature just to kill a few miners. There's something important down there, and we're gonna get it.
