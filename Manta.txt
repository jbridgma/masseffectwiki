The manta is a large flying creature native to the Andromeda galaxy. It usually sighted swimming through the air on various locations in the Heleus Cluster such as Habitat 7, Havarl, and Firebase Paradox. It is the first non-sentient creature Ryder may encounter after Hyperion's arrival in Heleus.
The manta "swims" through the sky in an undulating motion. It emits a distinctive noise loud enough to be heard on the ground. Its outline is roughly shaped like a flat scorpion: its outer rock-like skin helps it blend while on the ground and the reddish organs on its underside appear to be gas bladders that help it float.
The creature's "mouth" is a vertical maw surrounded by large teeth. It has no visible eyes.
