Adrenaline Burst[]
Adrenaline Burst is an ability unlockable through the Assault Training talent. It resets the cooldown times on all recharging talents, including First Aid, so they can be used immediately.
Adrenaline Burst is effective for Soldiers and Vanguards during long battles, to keep Immunity online, reuse weapon talents such as Overkill, or refresh tech/biotic abilities. As it is not a tech or biotic ability itself, Adrenaline Burst is unaffected by the cooldown-delaying effects of Damping, making it an ideal way to counteract Damping's effects.
It's particularly strong even at minimum rank for low-level characters who have to contend with very long recharge times on their abilities. At maximum rank plus the corresponding Specialization (see below), Adrenaline Burst can be used as a substitute for Armor Upgrades that improve ability cooldowns, allowing players to instead equip other mods that might be more impactful.
Unfortunately, squad AI isn't particularly intelligent about using Adrenaline Burst—Ashley and Garrus have a tendency to use it before they've even used any other abilities, meaning they receive no value from it. The only real way around this is to turn automatic squad power use off in the menu.
