Description[]
Serao is a standard hydrogen-helium gas giant. Its more obvious features are a pair of gigantic storm cells; one in the northern hemisphere, and one in the south. While richer in helium-3 than Allusah, the difficulties of extraction from Serao's gravity well and stormy atmosphere led to the other gas giant's development.
Serao has over 80 moons, ranging from a radius of 50 to 2,000 kilometers. The asari Tersicor Council has established an observation post on one of the larger moons to study the planet's twin storm systems.
