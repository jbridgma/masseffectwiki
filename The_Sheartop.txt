The Sheartop is a narrowly-defined strip of plateau west of Prodromos. The colony lies directly below its sheer cliffs, and it is conventionally reachable from there through a mountain path north, or south though Outland Spire via a vehicle trail through some Remnant and kett encampments. It is notable chiefly for being the main bastion of kett forces on Eos, which overlooks the Presson Dunes to its west.
The area has one Forward Station site to the east of the kett stronghold, and no endemic wildlife.
The Sheartop was given its self-referential name by Grace Lito, causing Pathfinder Ryder to suppose she eventually ran out of names for the planet's features.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Should Ryder eradicate the kett presence in the stronghold, Prodromos sends teams to check out the structure left behind.
