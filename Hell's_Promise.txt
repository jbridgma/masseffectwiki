Hell's Promise refers to the area spanned by the gargantuan derelict Remnant ship on Elaaden. Situated far to the northwest from The Paradise and bounded by the Sea of Ataraxia and Languish on most sides, it is vast enough that using the ND1 Nomad is required to traverse the hulk's length in an appreciable amount of time.
The starship is only 41% exposed to the elements. Its interior is corrupted by pockets of Scourge, though the ship is still functional enough to have numerous mechs, turrets, consoles and flash-forged technologies still active and about. Scavengers have been trying to salvage what they can, despite danger from Remnant bots and fellow outlaws.
