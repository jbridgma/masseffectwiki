This article is about the DLC interactive comic before Mass Effect 2. For the interactive comic in the Mass Effect 3: Special Edition, see Mass Effect: Genesis 2.


Mass Effect: Genesis is a downloadable "interactive backstory comic" produced by Dark Horse Comics for the PlayStation 3 release of Mass Effect 2 and later made available for Xbox 360 and PC.[1] Genesis was released on January 18, 2011 for PlayStation 3, and May 17, 2011 for Xbox 360 and PC. An updated version of the comic, Mass Effect: Genesis 2, is included in the Mass Effect 3: Special Edition for Wii U.
Genesis fills the role of Mass Effect for new players by introducing them to the story of the original game and allowing them to make six of the major plot decisions that Xbox 360 and PC players could make (see Save File Transfer). If downloaded, the comic appears between the opening level and character customization. There are two versions of the comic, one each for a male and female Commander Shepard.[2]

Choices[]
The six choices that players can make in Mass Effect: Genesis are as follows:[2]

Who became Shepard's love interest?
Should the Rachni Queen on Noveria be freed or destroyed?
What is the fate of Urdnot Wrex on Virmire?
Who is sacrificed on Virmire, Ashley Williams or Kaidan Alenko?
What happens to the Citadel Council during the Battle of the Citadel?
Who does Shepard endorse to represent humanity on the Council, David Anderson or Donnel Udina?
Notes[]
If you used Mass Effect: Genesis to customize your Mass Effect 2 playthrough with Mass Effect story decisions on the Xbox 360, and you then want to do additional Mass Effect 2 playthroughs by importing your initial Mass Effect 2 save games, you should delete Mass Effect: Genesis before attempting to start the new playthrough. If you don’t, the game will force you through the interactive comic even though you’re importing an earlier Mass Effect 2 playthrough.
If you used Mass Effect: Genesis, Miranda won't ask about your choice for human councilor on the shuttle to Minuteman Station (since your choice will be saved through the comic).
Imported playthroughs from Mass Effect still trigger Mass Effect: Genesis; the player's major choices in the game are then shown through the comic, skipping the usual dialogue wheels (the sole exception being the choice of human councilor, since the original game did not properly save that choice, though this is also autoplayed in the Mass Effect Legendary Edition due to it properly importing the choice). Choices not accounted for in the comic are still carried over.
For imported playthroughs, Genesis always depicts Benezia dying in Liara's arms, even if Liara was not brought to Noveria.
Mass Effect: Genesis does not mention some events and subjects that were part of Mass Effect, namely the mission on Feros,[3] and the geth and their overall involvement in the game. Additionally, no assignments are explored - they are considered unfinished.
The meeting with the Rachni Queen says she took her drones with her, but all the drones at Peak 15 were insane and Shepard had to kill them.
In Mass Effect Legendary Edition, playing through Mass Effect: Genesis is optional, with a prompt appearing before it normally plays.
Choosing not to recruit either Wrex or Garrus is not taken into account; Genesis assumes both became part of Shepard's team.
Pricing[]
Mass Effect: Genesis is available for free on PlayStation 3,[4] for $3.99 on Xbox 360,[5] and for 320 BioWare Points on PC.[6]
