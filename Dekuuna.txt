Description[]
The elcor homeworld, Dekuuna, overflows with natural resources protected by law, from large deposits of precious metals to vast forests. The elcor themselves live in rich grasslands near the equator. The majority of Dekuuna's settlements are tucked within this belt, as the conservative elcor feel little desire to build outside their comfort zone. Their twin capitals are for migrations from the wet season to the dry season, a tradition made obsolete by modern technology but still observed.
After the destruction of the elcor navy, Reapers moved in their ground troops to occupy the cities. This has taken longer than most civilized worlds, as the elcor have spread out into smaller, distant settlements, reflecting their preference for close-knit family communities instead of densely packed cities.

Additional Information[]
Native flora includes the onuffri blossom. These are thick, bulbous purple flowers that grow in the planet's savannas.
