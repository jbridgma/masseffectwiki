2.1 Speak to the angara who scanned you


3 Rewards


Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: A Trail of Hope II

Once you have been granted full access to Aya's capital city, Pathfinder Ryder is scanned discreetly by an angara outside the Resistance Headquarters (marked with a).

Walkthrough[]
This task is completed simply by talking to the angara in question. There are a number of conversational choices that ultimately lead to the same outcome.

Speak to the angara who scanned you[]
The angara named Daanfre claims to be working and can't be bothered. Either of the dialogue choices calls her out and she eventually admits to scanning you. She is a biological researcher, and asks for a more in-depth scan. You may choose to let her scan Ryder freely, or get to scan her first.
Daanfre emphasizes how important family is to the angara. She voices concerns that the Initiative races will outnumber the angara someday. You can either empathize or share a more logical observation.
After the mission's completion, Daanfre can be talked to about a number of subjects related (or tangentially related) to the scan.
