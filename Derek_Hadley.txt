Derek Hadley is a member of Task Force Aurora, serving under Dr. Garret Bryson as a research assistant. Based out of Dr. Bryson's Lab, he has been working on the Citadel for a few months.







“There won't be an Earth left to save...” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 3 follow.




When Commander Shepard arrives at the lab at Admiral Hackett's request, Hadley is tasked by Dr. Bryson to check with the field teams, compile data on Leviathan, and bring it to him. Instead of serving the data, Hadley produces a pistol and shoots him. Hadley is about to turn the weapon on Shepard though the Spectre manages to disarm him. He cryptically warns Shepard that "the darkness can't be breached" before going catatonic. 
Later, in the presence of armed C-Sec guards, Hadley regains his faculties and has no idea of what just happened. He claims his consciousness was somewhere "dark" and "cold". Horrified at the aftermath, he vehemently denies responsibility for Bryson's death even with all the evidence against him. 
EDI suggests Hadley has been indoctrinated. The assistant explains his team have been tracking Leviathan leads, but once he goes on detail about an artifact relevant to the matter he clutches his head in pain and again warns Shepard against investigating further, reiterating his earlier admonition that "the darkness cannot be breached." His eyes roll up and he collapses unconscious afterward.
The C-Sec guards take Hadley to a clinic for medical attention. Shepard later receives word that he is in a vegetative state, believed by his doctors to be permanent.
