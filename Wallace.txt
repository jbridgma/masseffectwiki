Description[]
An unusually small Pegasid or "hot Jupiter," Wallace was originally an extrasolar planet that entered this system and was captured by the gravity well of the G-class star Skepsis. Tidally locked, Wallace's "hot side" reaches temperatures over 2,500 degrees Celsius.
While not large enough proportionate to the star to cause eclipses visible from Watson, it is easily seen at dawn or dusk as one of the brightest objects in the sky.

Trivia[]
Since the planets in the Skepsis system are probably named for famous scientists and thinkers, Wallace is possibly named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who independently proposed a theory of evolution due to natural selection.
