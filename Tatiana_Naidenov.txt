Mass Effect (cut)


Tatiana Naidenov is a character who was cut from Mass Effect. She was a prostitute operating out of Ruushok's bar on Throw Down station on Caleston.
During her time working as a prostitute, Naidenov was apparently rather popular. At some point, security chief Jason Harrah met her as a customer, and she was surprised by his polite manners and respectful attitude which set him apart from the rest. As the two fell in love, Harrah made a deal with her employer, the Union (via Sessa Tarrent), to be able to stay with her in exchange for keeping out of their business. However, after the war with the Cartel began, Naidenov was forced to tell Harrah she was breaking up and that she never loved him, before being taken away and guarded by hired mercenary Sebastian Van Heerden, who keeps everyone away from her.
During the course of the mission, Commander Shepard may meet Naidenov after convincing Van Heerden to be allowed to talk to her. She may then profess her profound love for Harrah, and Shepard may be able to convince Harrah to quit alcohol in resolve. If things go badly when Harrah goes to The Seventh Moon to confront Van Heerden, the latter manages to fatally wound Harrah, and Tatiana cries by his side as he dies. Otherwise, the couple leaves the bar unharmed, and Harrah suggests hiding Tatiana in a safe place until things blow over. Shepard may suggest letting her on board the SSV Normandy for a time, which will make her appear in the cargo hold until Liara T'Soni is rescued, or Harrah can simply find her a good hide-out by himself. At the end of the mission, the two are reunited once more and happily announce they're getting married.
