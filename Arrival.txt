Arrival is a DLC pack for Mass Effect 2. It was accidentally revealed on February 21, 2011 by the addition of three new trophies in a patch for the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2.[1][2][3] While the addition of the trophies was intentional, BioWare assumed they would be invisible.[4] BioWare released the first screenshot of Arrival on March 14, 2011, officially confirming the existence of the DLC pack.[5][6] Arrival was released on March 29, 2011.[7] Like most of the DLC for the original Mass Effect trilogy games, it is included in Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Admiral Hackett returns, playing "a prominent role" in the pack.[7]
