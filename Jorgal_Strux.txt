“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Mass Effect: Andromeda[]
Fourteen months after the Nexus' arrival in Heleus, Jorgal Strux meets with Nakmor Drack and Pathfinder Ryder, telling them that Nakmor Morda was plotting an attack on the Nexus and that they should meet with his contact, Ravanor Brenk. 
Later, when Ryder chases a drive core from a downed Remnant ship all the way to the Scavenger Flophouse ("Misery"), the Pathfinder is surprised to find Strux's men guarding the drive core. Upon Ryder's return to New Tuchanka, it is revealed that Strux had lied to Morda that Ryder had sold the drive core to scavengers. 
With his treachery exposed, Strux, harboring an old grudge of how his father joined Clan Nakmor for admiring Morda's grandfather, thus being declared "not worth killing" by other krogan, then admitted his ambition to undermine Morda and become the new overlord. He then engaged Morda in hand-to-hand combat, only to be defeated. Morda reprimanded Strux for putting the entire colony at risk for a grudge he carried through dark space and banished him and his underlings from the colony, remarking on the irony that he himself had become "not worth killing".
