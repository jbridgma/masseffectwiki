Ialessa is a system in asari territory. Sanves is the only habitable terrestrial world in the system and a tourist destination, and Zylium acts as a refueling spot and auxiliary hospitality sector.
The system has little else in terms of resources other than copper deposits in Nossia. Of particular note is a planet-encircling supercollider in Trikalon that's targeted by the Reapers only days after its first activation.
