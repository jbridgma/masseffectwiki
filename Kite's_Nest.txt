The batarian home cluster Kite's Nest contains their homeworld Khar'shan, situated in the Harsa system. In 2186, it is among the first places invaded by the Reapers, who use it as a staging ground to further their invasion of the galaxy.
Due to the Batarian Hegemony's penchant for secrecy, surveillance, and disinformation, there may be scattered pockets of survivors amongst the worlds annihilated by the Reapers.
