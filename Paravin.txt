Description[]
Paravin is a small, unremarkable rock world. The surface is scorching hot, and mainly composed of calcium with deposits of aluminum. Paravin's low mass has left it tidally locked to the star Han. If there were any resources of value, mining stations could be established on the relatively temperate "twilight band".

Survey Text[]

“Scans of Paravin revealed an unmanned station in geosynchronous orbit. Your salvage team found no evidence on the origins of the station, but they did find one of Matriarch Dilinaga's writings on board.”
