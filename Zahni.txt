“There won't be an Earth left to save...” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 3 follow.




Zahni is an inhospitable world with a toxic atmosphere and low gravity. Because of this, Alliance troopers stationed there are expected to wear full survival gear. Despite its inhospitable environment, Zahni is important due to its deposits of Element Zero, an element critical for FTL travel.
During the Reaper War, a squad of Alliance troopers, including Sergeant Olembe and Private Talavi, are assigned to the eezo mining facility on the planet as Alliance intel anticipates an attack by Cerberus. Olembe also states that there is a possibility that the planet will eventually fall under attack by the Reapers as well. Whether Zahni did in fact fall under Reaper or Cerberus attack is not stated.
