Player Notes[]
Poison Strike fills a similar role as other mobility powers like Biotic Charge, Havoc Strike and Shadow Strike; but has the following differences:
Poison Strike does not lock onto a target at any range but instead launches the Turian Cabal Vanguard a set distance, damaging enemies in her path.
Poison Strike does not restore the Turian Cabal Vanguard's barrier, but she is invulnerable during the power's animation.
Poison Strike does not require locking onto a target, and it can be used to quickly pass through walls, solid objects, or other obstacles.
Like Charge, Poison Strike can detonate all four types of Power Combos.
By aiming slightly down into the floor, Poison Strike will cover a shorter distance, allowing a skilled player more accurate jumps. This is particularly useful when reviving fallen teammates. With the Double Dash evolution, the Cabal becomes an exceptional medic.
Poison Strike tends not to hit enemies in its path near the end of the travel distance, especially if the enemy was not target locked in the HUD, which is especially noticeable with the Range evolution of the power.
