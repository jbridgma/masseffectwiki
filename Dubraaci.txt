Description[]
Dubraaci's nickel and cobalt surface defies the planet's intense heat to remain solid. Trace readings of element zero are present but difficult to pinpoint.

Anomaly[]
Crevasse[]
DATA:

Length: 328 km
Average width: 6 km
Maximum height: 6 km
ANALYSIS:
This narrow canyon is startlingly deep. A river of magma rich with minerals runs at the base, and alien technology - possibly old angaran facilities - lines the walls. This must be the source of the planet's element zero.
