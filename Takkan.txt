Description[]
Orbiting closest to the F-class star Amada, Takkan is a blistering, sun-blasted hell. Neither its carbon dioxide nor its weak magnetic field provides any protection from the star's harsh radiation. Fortunately, Takkan has few significant resources, and is only notable for an unusual purple desert in the southern hemisphere, thought to be the result of eroded spessartite.
