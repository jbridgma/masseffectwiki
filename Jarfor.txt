Description[]
Jarfor is a close-orbiting "hot Jupiter" hydrogen-helium gas giant with clouds of airborne silicate and deeper layers of sodium. In composition, it is extraordinarily similar to 51 Pegasi's planet Bellerophon (one of the first extrasolar planets discovered by humanity in the late 20th century).
Despite its great size, Jarfor is actually rather low-mass; the incredible heat of the star Hoc has caused its atmosphere to expand. In fact, Jarfor is so low-mass, it is tidally locked to Hoc. The temperature difference between the sunward "hot pole" and the dark side "cold pole" creates constant hurricane-force winds.
