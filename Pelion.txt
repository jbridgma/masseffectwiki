Pelion is a gateway system to the rest of the Nimbus Cluster. Asari are centered on Trategos and they hold mining and research operations on the rest. 
When the Reapers arrived, surveillance systems on Aitis broadcast the alarm to the rest of the cluster. The Reapers retaliated by destroying them, and they are currently besieging the hardy colonists of Trategos.
