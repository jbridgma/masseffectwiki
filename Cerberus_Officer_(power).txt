Cerberus Officer's passive squad bonuses will remain in effect even if Miranda falls in battle or she becomes unavailable at specific points during certain missions. Note that this does NOT include situations where Miranda is not technically one of Shepard's two squadmates; for example, her passive will not provide any benefit to the team if she is chosen as the biotic specialist during Collector Base: The Long Walk.
