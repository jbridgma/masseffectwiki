Kralla's Song is a bar in Kadara Port. It is owned and tended by an asari called Umi Henon.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Kralla's Song is the location for the meeting arranged between Pathfinder Ryder and Resistance contact Shena. After the meeting, the bartender may be spoken to for information about the port and the local factions it's contested by. Ryder can also order drinks from the bar.

Layout[]
The bar is connected to Kadara Market via a heavy-duty door. It has a six-seater balcony antechamber, where below it is the bar proper: a small room for five tables and the bartender's corner. The northern end of the room has a window into a sweeping vista of the docking pads and the badlands beyond.
On the upper level, near the entrance, a salarian Collective recruiter can be talked to for more information about the organisation. He disappears once a faction emerges as the undisputed ruler of the port, and is replaced by two Outcast guards if the gang retains control. Nakmor Drack and Liam Kosta can be seen loitering in the bar during mission downtimes on Kadara.

Trivia[]
The bar appears to be named after an asari demon of misfortune, which also has a planet in the Milky Way as a namesake.
