The Drall is an insectoid creature that resembles some hybrid of horseshoe crab and lobster. It possesses six long limbs, a grey carapace with glowing spots, and a horned head. It has four eyes per side of a mouth on the underside that's ringed with sharp teeth.
The creatures can be found on Havarl and Kadara. A dead Drall will not leave any visible carcass; it explodes instead, revealing its greenish inner organs. They usually leave behind some materials such as Shell Filaments.
Drall are edible, and their pinchers are known to be used in low-cost soups.
