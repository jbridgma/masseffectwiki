The Omega Clinic is a medical center in Omega's Gozu District.







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




This facility is supervised by professor Mordin Solus with assistance from his human assistant Daniel and other personnel. In 2185, the Omega Clinic treats non-human patients afflicted by a genetically engineered plague. Many of the clinic's clients gratefully attest to how much Mordin helped them. After Commander Shepard assists in deploying a cure that Mordin developed to counter the plague, the professor accepts a posting on the Normandy SR-2 to join the mission to stop the Collectors, who it is revealed developed the plague. If Daniel survives an excursion into vorcha territory, he takes over management of the clinic, with assistance from security mechs left behind by Mordin.
