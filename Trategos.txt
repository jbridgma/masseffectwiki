Description[]
Largely frozen ice except for liquid seas at the equator, Trategos has the coldest winters of any asari colony, taking it down near the second tier of habitability. Trategos's colonists are a hardy bunch, using the freezing winter months to test whether newcomers have what it takes to carve out a life on the planet.
Trategos's colonists are fighting the Reapers in a guerrilla war, their best resource being submarine vehicles that can slip under the sea ice to mask their heat. Unfortunately, these have not proven good tools for taking back population centers from the Reapers, and for now the colonists will have to be satisfied with commando actions to harass their synthetic oppressors.
