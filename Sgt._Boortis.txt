Sergeant Boortis is a human Blue Suns mercenary, who, along with Captain Vorhess, hijacked the MSV Strontium Mule. However he was greedy and treacherous and planned on betraying Captain Vorhess. He created a list with names loyal to Vorhess that he and his cohorts would kill, so they could take the ship's valuable cargo for themselves. He uses Commander Shepard's arrival as a way to dispose of Vorhess, by planning to ambush the weakened victor in the ship's bridge. The ambush failed, and Sergeant Boortis and all of his fellow conspirators were killed by Commander Shepard.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Sergeant Boortis is equipped with an M-76 Revenant armed with Disruptor Ammo.
Defensive
Boortis has strong shields and armor, high health, and Tech Armor ability.

Tactics[]
He has a lot of firepower at any range, so you might want to make him a priority. You can use the narrow corridor to funnel him and his men and engage them one-on-one.
The Arc Projector can take him out in a few shots and cause trouble for his squad at the same time, even when they're out of your line of fire.
