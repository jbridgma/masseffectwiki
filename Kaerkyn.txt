DATA:
Classification: Insect
Origin: Andromeda
ANALYSIS:
An oversized insect with two grasping pedipalps for hunting and defense. Burrows and nests underground. Not innately hostile, but will attack when threatened. Could pose a danger, if encountered in large numbers. 

Capabilities[]
Offensive
These creatures have a melee attack. 

Defensive
Kaerkyn are unprotected by shields, armor, or barriers.

Tactics[]
These oversized spider-lobsters are big enough to be ground under the Nomad's wheels. They can follow the Nomad around but they can only attack at certain positions. If they happen to be directly beneath the vehicle, they can take a bite. Otherwise, they will only stand by the sides upon catching up with the Nomad.
