Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Bloodlust Stacks:
You must have at least one kill to receive the bonuses. Simply having Bloodlust active without amassing kills doesn't have any effect beyond slowing your power recharge speed.
Every time a kill is made, the duration of the bonuses is reset to 15 seconds. Individual kills are not tracked on separate timers, and individual stacks cannot run out on their own. If 15 seconds pass without any kills, then all accumulated bonuses are lost.
Because of the above two factors, it's common to lose all accumulated stacks between waves, though sometimes they can be preserved.
Kills with the Cobra Missile Launcher do grant stacks.
Unlike the Rage power for the krogan classes where the player character must get the actual killing blow to generate stacks, kill assists do count towards building Bloodlust stacks. This makes a damage-over-time power like Flamer not only useful for building stacks but keeping them active in team games, as burning enemies that die continuously feed the player stacks, regardless of who got the actual kill.
Killing minor "summoned" enemy types such as Swarmers, Combat Drones, Geth Turrets, and Seeker Swarms does not generate stacks.
Health regeneration affects how many health points are regenerated per second at each stack.
At Rank 1, you would regenerate 50 health points per second at each stack.
At Rank 3, you would regenerate 65 health points per second at each stack.
At Rank 4, you would regenerate 90, 115, 140 health points per second, scaling respectively to each stack.
At Rank 6, you would regenerate 140, 215, 290 health points per second, scaling respectively to each stack.
This is because each stack gives an increased percentage to health regeneration instead of the unit that percentage presents.  Rank 1 does not increase per stack, because there is no percentage to increase it by.  Rank 3 does not increase per stack, as it is intentionally not stated in the game.  Rank 4 and 6 give you a percentage increase per stack.  This means that at Rank 6, you would have 30% added to your base, and an additional 150% per stack.  This would give you 180% at Stack 1, 330% at Stack 2, 480% at Stack 3.
Assuming health regeneration happened at intervals of seconds, it would take 2.5 seconds to regenerate your full health at 750 health points with fully upgraded health regeneration and Stack 3 Bloodlust.
Growl: Bloodlust's primary disadvantage is that the stack animation interupts most continuous fire. As the stack increases, the chance of an animation triggering is 5%, 20%, and then 50% on the final stack.[1]
The 'stack' animation interrupts the weapon firing/reload animations and can be used for reload cancelling on snipers that have a very long reload.
However, a continuous fire weapon such as the Reegar Carbine will continue to fire and deal damage whilst the animation is active, if the player gets a kill whilst shooting.
While the stack animation is going on, the vorcha's movement speed suddenly and dramatically increases for about a second.  This can be used to slide in one direction and cover a considerable distance away from nearby targets, a useful defensive skill if engaged in combat with melee enemies like Brutes.
Unlike shields, health regeneration begins immediately and cannot be halted (even with flames or a Banshee's biotics), allowing the vorcha to take incredible amounts of sustained damage.
Strategies
Be advised that while vorcha are capable of sustaining incredible damage, they can only do so if the damage is gradual or slow. Any enemies that inflict singular, big hits, or an extremely large number of little hits in a short space of time will render Bloodlust almost completely useless. Because Atlases, Geth Primes, Geth Hunters, Ravagers, Phantoms, Banshees, Cerberus Turrets and Brutes can inflict large amounts of damage in a short space of time, caution should be used where needed to allow Bloodlust the time it needs to heal your wounds. Nemeses can also be dangerous to vorcha since one shot depletes all health and renders them vulnerable to a quick incapacitation from other troops.
As long as the player avoids taking too much damage at once, a bloodlusted vorcha class can definitely be viable in Platinum games even without needing to use gear or consumables like Cyclonic Barriers to increase their naturally weak shields.
Teaming up with a volus class with Shield Boost evolved for 50% damage reduction is extremely powerful, making a vorcha that much more resistant to high-damage attacks and increasing the value of its regenerating health pool.
There are no gear items or consumables that directly improve player health, only shields and shield regeneration. Therefore, it's usually better to focus on improving damage output, or going for items that improve the amount of medi-gel or Ops Packs that can be carried.
