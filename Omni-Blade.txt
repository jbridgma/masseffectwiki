Description[]
This disposable silicon-carbide weapon can be forged by an omni-tool's fabricator. The transparent omni-blade is suspended in a mass effect field safely away from the user's skin and warning lights illuminated the field so the searing blade only burns the intended enemy.

Features[]
The Omni-Blade is the starting melee weapon. It has no special features.
Ranks I - IV & VI - X use Silicon for development while Rank V uses Shell Filaments.
Strategies[]
The Omni-Blade is very weak and basic. It is considered standard equipment, meaning that it does not have to be researched and is inexpensive to develop.

Trivia[]
No matter which melee weapon Pathfinder Ryder has equipped, aerial melee attacks always produce an effect that seems to be the result of an Omni-Blade.
Commander Shepard could only stock bash in Mass Effect, the Omni-Blade was introduced in Mass Effect 3 and has been used since. Mass Effect: Andromeda is the first game that allows the player character to choose different melee weapons.
Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning and its remaster Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning include a pair of daggers based on the Omni-Blade.
