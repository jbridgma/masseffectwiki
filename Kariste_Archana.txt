Kariste Archana is the appointed mayor of the Andromeda Initiative outpost on New Tuchanka, provided Nakmor Morda consented to the construction of the outpost.
The mayor is tasked to restore relations between the Nexus and Clan Nakmor. She praises Pathfinder Ryder's contribution in helping secure that relationship in the first place. She thinks the Nexus leadership's decisions during the uprising were shortsighted and she intends to not repeat the same mistakes.  
Kariste is concerned about an Architect that has been spotted near the settlements, worried that it would threaten the safety of the colonists. She entrusts Pathfinder Ryder to defeat the architect.
Some of the issues the mayor confronts include a krogan complaining about an Initiative trespasser inside his family quarters. The krogan warns the guilty party will lose his hand if he does it again, though Kariste refuses to be intimidated and vows to escalate the issue, eliciting a laugh from the krogan.
When Ryder asks how things are going, the mayor reports slow progress, but making progress nonetheless.
