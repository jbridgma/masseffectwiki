The shemrys is an insect resembling a giant green-and-orange cockroach. It can be found on Eos, Havarl, and Kadara. It has five eyes on each side of the head and it walks around on six orange legs, of which the front two is hued pinkish at the extremities. It appears to have wings, although it has never been seen using them to fly.
They sometimes drop Soft Chitin when killed.
