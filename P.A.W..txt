Description[]
The Particle Accelerator Weapon (P.A.W.) fires a continuous high-energy particle beam with incredible accuracy. For short-term operations, its power supply is effectively inexhaustible and overheating is the only concern. The P.A.W. combines Remnant particle beam technology with Andromeda Initiative targeting and stabilizers. Theoretically, it may be scalable to a ship-sized version.

Features[]
Powerful and accurate, the P.A.W. is a valuable addition to the armory of anyone who can wield it properly. Its damage output is only slightly above average for its class, but its pinpoint accuracy ensures that its entire firepower hits exactly where the targeting reticule is pointed. This makes the P.A.W. a lethal tool in the hands of an experienced marksman, but a questionable choice for those who can't reliably keep their aim on their target.
Being a Remnant weapon, the P.A.W. is subject to all the advantages and drawbacks of this weapon family. 
Its internal heat sink gives it infinite spare ammunition, but its immense rate of fire means that it empties its clip very quickly, which forces it into its lengthy cooldown animation if the player fails to keep an eye on their ammo count. A high-level AR Magazine mod goes a long way to make the most of its withering hail of fire.
The P.A.W. is completely useless beyond mid-range because its plasma beam simply dissipates past its effective range. Therefore the gun either deals full damage to the target, or none at all if it is even an inch too far away.
Like all Remnant weapons, the P.A.W. can only be acquired by crafting it at a Research Station. It will never appear as random loot or in APEX loot containers.
The P.A.W. is unable to use an Assault Rifle Receiver Mod.
The multiplayer P.A.W. gained improvements to damage and clip size during post-launch updates. Its reload speed also decreased from 2.5 seconds to 2 seconds.

Strategies[]
SingleplayerMultiplayer
Singleplayer
The weapon combines well with the Bio-Converter augmentation. This essentially allows constant laser firing interrupted only by the Bio-Converter itself.
The grenade launcher and sticky grenade launchers work very well with the P.A.W., given that the weapon's lack of ammo problems and extreme rate of fire synergize with the explosive projectiles fired by said augmentations.
Multiplayer
The P.A.W's highly visible beam helps players determine whether they're hitting a target even at long distances, and coupled with its good damage it's one of the weapons favorably anticipated when opening packs with chances for Ultra-Rares.
As a weapon with infinite ammo, it's one of the guns recommended whenever the mission parameters specify no resupplies.
