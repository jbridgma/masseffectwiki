Description[]
Prospect is a hydrogen-nitrogen gas giant with 13 known moons, most of which seemed to have dense heavy metal deposits on first scan, starting a resource rush by the colonists from nearby Horizon. In a tragic turn of events, a galactic uranium surplus drove half the mining firms out of business, and the surfaces of some moons are littered with the bodies of executives who committed suicide by airlock. Today's mining corporations have reached a much more palatable equilibrium, and hold more diversified and sustainable portfolios.
Prospect is within the "frost line" of its solar system, where ice giants do not normally form. For this reason, it is believed to have been an extrasolar capture.
