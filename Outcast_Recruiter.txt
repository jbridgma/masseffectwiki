The Outcast Recruiter is an asari who loiters in Kadara Market and loudly extols the virtues of joining the Outcasts. She fervently believes in the group and Sloane Kelly's leadership.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Like many who joined the Andromeda Initiative, the recruiter came to Andromeda to be part of something bigger than herself. However, disappointing leadership during the disastrous arrival soured her opinion on the Initiative. She threw her lot in with the Outcast faction of the exiles, and while it wasn't what she originally signed up for she's content with the order, direction, and family the group gave her.
The recruiter immediately discerns Pathfinder Ryder as Initiative due to their shiny gear in comparison to the average. She's cordial enough to the Pathfinder but warns them Sloane will have a more hostile reaction.
The recruiter is a source of introductory information on Outcasts and their recruiting practices. She also toes the party line of being hostile to the Collective and leaves it to Sloane to decide when they'll deal with the problem.
Like most of her fellow Outcasts, the recruiter is gone from the port should the Collective win the power struggle for Kadara Port.
