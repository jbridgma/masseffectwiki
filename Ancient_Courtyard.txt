“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.





The Ancient Courtyard is a region on Havarl, self-evident in name due to being bounded by Remnant walls and towers on all sides. It lies east of the Chasm of the Builders, accessible only after the Roekaar have repaired the only bridge above the chasm.
A small gateway checkpoint serves as the only way in and out of the courtyard. Inside, there is ample space for a Forward Station a few meters out of the gateway. Mithrava Ascent can be seen to the south. Old Pelaav is at the easternmost boundary of the region. The world's Remnant vault is also at the southern part of the courtyard, rising from the ground after all three monoliths have been activated.
The area is relatively flat, teeming with life and resources, and has no major obstructions.
