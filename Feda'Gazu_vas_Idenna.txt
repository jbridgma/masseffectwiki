Feda'Gazu vas Idenna is a quarian, a crewman of the Idenna who commands the Cyniad scout vessel. 







“Salvation comes with a cost.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Ascension follow.




Feda is the leader of the scout team who meets up with Golo on Shelba, intending to buy much-needed technology. Though she is prepared for Golo's betrayal, Feda is taken by surprise when she defuses an explosive trap Golo set in his truck, a trap that overloads her weapon and knocks out her shields. 
Feda is then shot by Pel with a Volkov sniper rifle from over a mile away; she is hit twice in the shoulder and knee before he kills her with a shot to the head. Feda is then stripped of her environmental suit, which is used by Pel's team mate to ambush the Cyniad's remaining crew.
