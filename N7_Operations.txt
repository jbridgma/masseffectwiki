During the Reaper War, Allied forces began recruiting anyone, soldier or mercenary, to serve on the front lines of the conflict. The most experienced operatives formed squads to secure objectives, evacuate civilians, and battle Cerberus or the Reapers deep in enemy territory. Initially led by N7 Alliance marines, these squads were nicknamed the N7 Special Ops. In light of these teams' exemplary service and remarkable bravery, the Alliance allowed this unofficial name to spread across the ranks as a sign of respect for their efforts.
Here follows a list of known N7 operations and the related briefing and debriefing messages sent by Citadel Allied Command and mostly signed by Admiral Hackett.

Operation Goliath


Citadel Allied Command is mounting a galaxy-wide operation to cripple the Reapers’ shock troops: the turian-krogan hybrids known as “brutes.” To flush out Reaper ground forces, N7 teams are deploying to engage the enemy in key theaters. Heavy reinforcements are expected anywhere fighting begins.

Operation: Goliath Success

Soldiers of the Milky Way –
It is my honor to announce that Operation Goliath was an overwhelming success. By targeting the brutes of the Reaper forces, we dealt them a blow from which they will not soon recover. As I’m sure you’re aware, a brute is made out of the parts of turians and krogan, somehow melded into one. For them to replace those troops, they’re going to have to capture turians and krogan together and alive—and you can ask your turian and krogan friends just how rarely that’s going to happen from now on.
Over a three-day period, you downed a staggering number of brutes, and countless husks and other Reaper creatures in the process. As it is, the Reapers have been pushed back in key positions as they try to make up for the holes you left in their army.
I am confident that word of this operation will get out and that it will give people hope. The stories I am hearing continue to amaze me. They are stories of soldiers braving fire to pull a fallen comrade to safety; they are stories of biotics charging enemies ten times their weight to buy their friends a critical second; they are stories of engineers with their fingers shot off, hacking mainframes with the stumps because their teammates needed them. Thousands of strike teams ran successful sorties against particularly deadly Reaper occupations – those squads will be recognized with a special commendation.
This brotherhood knows no race or species. It is a bond you are forging together, knowing that when the time came, you heard the call, and you answered it with all the skill and passion you could muster. That much… you can say to anyone.

With Reaper forces beaten back, relief efforts are under way in the newly-taken territory.
During this period, Reaper enemies will be severely depleted and there will be far fewer brutes than usual.

Looking ahead: Admiral Hackett has put out the call for advanced combatants among the N7 squads. These troops are being marshaled for an upcoming elite operation. Experience under fire leads to promotions….

Soldiers of the Milky Way –
As this week comes to a close, I am pleased at the gains we have made in Operation FORTRESS. Through smart, defensive fighting, we have held the ground we took in GOLIATH and trained countless members of our growing force.
While not be as glamorous as striking the enemy deep in their heart, taking modest objectives to help newcomers is a mission-critical objective. As you train, so shall you fight. And what you are training your compatriots to do is no small matter. You are taking a stranger into your unit and giving them the tools they need to kill a Reaper, to save your life, or to even give their life for your own. This can be taught, but only by someone who inspires them to be more than they were.
It takes guts to teach. It takes experience. It takes persistence. You are demonstrating these attributes to your squadmates, and it is these qualities that will win us this war.

While our comrades spread across the galaxy to carry on the fight, you must reconstitute your forces and bring new fighters to the fore.

Priority Update: Operation Exorcist


Soldiers of the Milky Way –
By now it is no secret that the Reaper War has had its share of logistical SNAFUs. It is to the galaxy’s credit that, when we put out the call for volunteers, we were answered by individuals of every species from Citadel [sic], Traverse, and even Terminus space. Unfortunately, the diversity of equipment sources meant our allies ran into hardware and software incompatibilities.
These brave men and women have been fighting beside you and, in doing so, have gone above and beyond normal duty. Because their units were not properly tracked, they fought without pay and sometimes without proper training, equipment, even rations. It is a mark of their character that these warriors took the grave task set before us and stuck it out through sheer determination.
It is time to honor their service. A volunteer task force has fabricated the necessary hardware and is rolling out compatibility software. When these installations are complete, these soldiers will benefit from being properly equipped and combat-ineffective troops will get off the bench. We’ll all have more comrades watching our backs, and we’re now watching theirs.

Re: Operation EXORCIST

Soldiers of the Milky Way –
It is with great pride that I announce that we stopped a galaxy-wide Cerberus offensive. They expected surprise and speed to be on their side. They had neither, and they quickly discovered who had the superior force. You thinned their ranks and made our command and control structures safer. Since no small number of my colleagues were their targets, I offer my personal thanks.
When an assassin dies, his target lives. When thousands of assassins die, their leadership loses a major strategic option. That is the blow you have dealt. It will take Cerberus time to recover from losing their elite Phantom soldiers, time we do not intend to give them. Captured Phantoms are being interrogated to help us crack down on more Cerberus cells and sleeper agents. The intelligence we won today will be critical in the battles we face tomorrow.
Regrettably, we cannot stomp Cerberus out all at once, not yet. Our primary focus must be on the Reapers. But had we not won today, we would be hard-pressed to defend our colonies and homeworlds. That means everything to the friends, families, and fellow citizens for whom we are fighting.
Good work.

Operation Silencer


Cerberus defectors have verified key intel on Reaper banshees to help provide us a vulnerability to exploit. Banshees are created from a specific kind of asari that cannot be replaced quickly, so we are diverting forces to focus on an all-out banshee extermination effort.
This task is an onerous one, and many of you are right to dread contact with these particular foes, but rest assured that we are prepared to reinforce your battalion with reserves. The vorcha want in, and as soon as they complete combined-arms training with our technically-skilled personnel, we will let them loose.

It is with great regret that I must announce the withdrawal of forces from several colonies in asari space. Reinforcing them proved untenable. While Operation SILENCER inflicted substantial casualties, the Reapers learned from our victories against the brutes, and they now know how to protect their own.
Rest assured that we too are learning from this conflict. Already, we are implementing plans to supply our forces with a better arsenal so that, when we next meet the enemy, they are ours. Until your next deployment, keep calm and carry on. We will pay the Reapers back soon enough.

Success!


From: Admiral Steven Hackett
Re: Operation SHIELDWALL
Confidentiality Classification: XB-PRIME
Distribution: N7 Forces Only
Soldiers of the Milky Way –
It will relieve many of you to know that Operation SHIELDWALL bought us the time we needed to get our reinforcements to the front. The most numerous of these are the vorcha, literally the galaxy’s most adaptable species. We’ve subjected vorcha to high pressures so they can survive on Irune, clubbed them to simulate a husk’s flailing, and even shot them so that their bodies learn to heal trauma. Fighting is a way of life to the vorcha. Right now, they are just what this galaxy needs.
Integrating so many vorcha has not been easy, and it is here that we must note the quarian contribution. Many quarians on their Pilgrimage actually refused the summons of the Migrant Fleet in order to serve against the Reapers. We assigned them the task of educating the vorcha in combined-arms operations against mechs and hardened targets. This came at great personal risk, since the vorcha’s style of “communication” often includes claws—the last thing a quarian in an envirosuit needs.
There is no better time to aim these warriors at the enemy. A Cerberus military outpost code-named Project Phoenix has defected to the Alliance in full, bringing with them inestimably valuable intelligence. Their project director said that, when he looked at Cerberus, he saw its ugly past: a long string of blackmail and assassination. When he looked at the Alliance, coordinating races from all corners of the galaxy to stop the Reapers, he saw the future.
Couldn’t have put it better myself.

Soldiers of the Milky Way –
I am pleased to announce that Operation MASTIFF worked as planned, and given its scope, that is no small accomplishment. Vorcha and allied reinforcements have landed on nearly all of the occupied homeworlds, in sufficient numbers to allow us to extract important data about Reaper invasion tactics. The next time the Reapers try to take a homeworld, they will find us ready and waiting.
As for the status of the resistance on these planets, we remain hopeful. Every time a processing center is bombed, every time a detention camp is liberated, we delay the Reapers and give organics time to regroup. This breathing room is essential to win the long war, and to give hope to the galaxy at large. If you want to see an immediate consequence of this success, I suggest visiting your quartermaster – the supply chain has been secured, and they’ve brought a few things you might like.
Well done.

Soldiers of the Milky Way –
It is a great feeling when a gambit succeeds, and I am pleased to announce that Operation SAVAGE was a success. At the end of Operation MASTIFF, I said that our supply chain was secure. The Reapers, of course, did their best to test that claim. They recognized this supply route through the central Terminus Systems and dispatched destroyers and troop transports to eliminate what they thought was a soft target.
They found otherwise. The Terminus worlds lacked the heavy warships of the Council militaries, so as part of Operation SAVAGE, we devoted significant space assets to reinforce them. The space assets came through, but that is to take nothing away from the ferocity and skill of the ground troops on these planets. When the Reapers landed, intent on turning those colony worlds into new sources of husk creatures, they met their match.
I cannot emphasize enough what a mess we’d be in if the Reapers had succeeded. A captured planet in our rear echelon would have meant facing shortages of critical materials or pulling additional assets from major fronts to compensate. Our strategists say we dodged a bullet—in my opinion, we stopped it cold.
Good work. That is all.

Re: Operation BROADSIDE

Soldiers of the Milky Way –
There is an old human expression: “You reap what you sow.” The word “reap” has been co-opted by our enemy, but this does not make the expression any less true. We have spent much time in recent weeks planting seeds. We recruited, we trained, we defended, all in the hopes that, sometime soon, we would have enough breathing room to mobilize against the enemy on a grand scale. Over the past few days, we did just that.
Operation BROADSIDE attacked Reapers all over the galaxy, and we made them take notice. They expected to fight asari on Thessia, turians on Palaven, batarians on Khar’shan, but what they got was turian bombardments covering vorcha troops using human tactics in asari streets. It was perhaps due to this complexity that BROADSIDE did not go as planned. We sought a way to defeat a numerically superior ground force with little loss of life, but there was no sure strategy to adopt. When we innovate, our enemy adapts. Yes, we’ve seen losses, but a war worth fighting does not come without a cost.
Take inspiration in that. I know it is discouraging to fight for alien real estate when we have not yet taken the battle to your own homeworld. Operational secrecy prevents me from saying exactly when we will deploy and in what strength. All I can say to those who are waiting is one word:
Soon.

By now you have probably heard that Operation OVERWATCH succeeded on many fronts. Frankly, I would not be surprised if this message goes unread until tomorrow due to excessive celebrating. You have struck the Reapers where they are strongest and lived to tell the tale. Credit goes to you, to those shuttle pilots who retrieved your teams, and to the many personnel who supported and planned the missions.
But I also want to speak to some of what you may be seeing in the media soon. Eventually, it will be public knowledge that we had operations on Earth, retrieving data and personnel necessary for the military and economic well-being of the galaxy.
This success will bring hope to billions of people. It will also enrage some of them. Be prepared for the tough questions – when are we starting our full-scale assault? Why retrieve this helium-3 magnate but not another one, or save my loved ones? Who are you to play God?
There are no good answers to these questions. The reality is, the Reapers have almost every conceivable advantage — numbers, firepower, technology – and we make do with what we have. We strike and retreat because facing the foe head-on would be a disaster. Nowhere is this truer than at Earth.
We have started to give them a death by a thousand cuts. Take heart in this, celebrate, and relax tonight. Tomorrow morning, we will get down to business, because there’s nine hundred and ninety left to go.

While we do not yet know what this new data will reveal, rest assured it will be put to good use. I don’t need to tell you that logs from a Reaper’s memory could prove invaluable. If we can decipher when and why it received the orders it did, we can start to predict their battle strategies, and that improves our chances both on Earth and throughout the galaxy.

While we will put the salvaged materials to good use, we’ve learned very little about the initial attacks or how we might counter similar attacks in the future.

Our teams destroyed a host of Atlas mechs, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. The drones we deployed captured Cerberus data detailing unusual Reaper movement and intelligence.

We have received eye-witness testimony of Collectors on the battlefield. This has been confirmed by our researchers who have been busy analyzing the Cerberus data recovered from Operation PATRIOT. The Collectors emerged from dark space on relatively low-velocity transport ships, allowing them to maintain a low profile while our attention was focused on the Reapers. It is believed that their arrival was meant to function as deadly reserves, wiping out pockets of resistance while our troops engaged the Reapers.

I cannot fully express my deep respect for all of you, the sapients of the Milky Way who serve together under our banner. When future generations look back on this war, they will see the courage and commitment it takes to change the fate of a galaxy. It has been a hard road, but at last: the end is in sight.
Finish it.

–Admiral Steven Hackett
