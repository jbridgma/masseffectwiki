Zymandis (soul name: Regards the Works of the Enkindlers in Despair) is an indoctrinated hanar diplomat found in the Private Offices of the Citadel Embassies. Years earlier, Zymandis had been part of a Systems Alliance raid on a batarian science lab studying Reaper technology, where he was indoctrinated. He later became a member of the hanar diplomatic staff on the Citadel.
Spectre Jondum Bau's investigation eventually leads him and Commander Shepard to Zymandis, who reveals he believes that because the Protheans became Collectors, and the Collectors serve the Reapers, then the hanar should also serve the Reapers. To this end, Zymandis attempts to upload a computer virus to cripple the automated planetary defense systems protecting Kahje, the hanar homeworld.
If Kasumi Goto is present during the mission, she disables the virus while Shepard takes out Zymandis's human accomplice, resulting in Jondum Bau shooting and killing Zymandis. The virus upload is stopped and Kahje is saved. If Kasumi is not present, Shepard must choose between saving Jondum Bau from the accomplice or stopping the virus.

Trivia[]
Zymandis' face and soul names are a reference to Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem Ozymandias:

"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
