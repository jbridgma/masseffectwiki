Prerequisite: Priority: Tuchanka (Mass Effect 3)

Prior to the First Contact War, a remote, frigid terrestrial world in Attican Beta hosted half of a turian interferometric telescope array. Connected by an expensive chain of FTL comm buoys to a similar telescope hosted at Gromar in the Voyager Cluster, the two functioned as a virtual "lens" with an effective aperture equal to the thousands of light years between them. The turians used this to map the Terminus Systems with great accuracy. 
In 2186, this array can be salvaged to help construct the Crucible.
