Description[]
Trelyn is a lifeless rock with a trace atmosphere of nitrogen and xenon. Its surface contains large amounts of iron and magnesium silicates. Due to the heavy cratered terrain, starships are discouraged form landing. A salarian religious cult claims that a certain pattern of overlapping craters in the southern hemisphere resembles their goddess.
