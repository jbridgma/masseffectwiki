Player Notes[]
Biotic Focus does not trigger any animations when used, therefore the player can activate it while running without stopping movement.
Biotic Focus can be kept active indefinitely; its duration far exceeds its recharge speed.
Biotic Shield: The barrier regeneration of the Biotic Shield evolution helps compensate for the Cabal Vanguard's lack of Charge.
With a fast cooldown, it can be spammed very often and helps greatly against any enemy attacks that delay shield recharge.
The invulnerability granted by the Biotic Shield evolution does not last long enough to provide any protection against sync kills, even the rapidly executed ones like a Phantom's sword stab. However, its ability to protect you from high-damage enemy attacks is still valuable, especially when used often.
Biotic Focus can be used while carrying an object without dropping it; Biotic Shield's invulnerability comes in handy here.
