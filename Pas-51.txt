Description[]
Many of the conditions on Pas-51 are amenable to the development of life (microbial at least), but its searing temperatures are an obstacle not easily overcome.

Anomaly[]
Mountain[]
DATA:

Height: 8.8 km
Origin: Tectonic
ANALYSIS:
Water vapor escapes from cracks in this mountain, suggesting that somewhere deep underground - where temperatures are far cooler - a reservoir may exist.  If lifeforms exist on Pas-51, it will be there.
