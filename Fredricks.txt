“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Fredricks is found in the bar near the Embassies. Commander Shepard can listen in as Fredricks boasts to his shipmates about visiting Sha'ira at the Consort's Chambers. 
If Shepard asks him about the Consort, Fredricks stutters an unconvincing answer, then shamefacedly confesses, much to the glee of Shepard's squadmates, that he never actually went to see Sha'ira because it costs half a year's credits just to speak to her.

Trivia[]
Cam Clarke, the voice actor for Private Fredericks, also provided the voices for Sky and Si Pat in BioWare's Jade Empire.
