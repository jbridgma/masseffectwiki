Description[]
Hard data on Wentania is very limited. When the system was charted by the Alliance surveyor Kupe, only a small, unmanned flyby probe was spared for the distant world. It is a small rock and ice planet, with a trace atmosphere of krypton and sulfur dioxide. Normandy's more detailed survey suggests the frozen terrestrial may be a suitable target for mining. While it is largely water ice, mapping of mass concentrations suggests it has a core of pure aluminum.

Properties[]
Albedo comes out to "-0.38", even before taking the SO2 anti-greenhouse smog into account.
