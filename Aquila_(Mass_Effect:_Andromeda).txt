Aquila is an agent of the Collective who works at the Collective Base.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Aquila's personal log in the personnel quarters of the Collective Base indicates he doesn't concern himself much with affairs beyond his orders. When given a job to do, though, he does what he's told.
Should Pathfinder Ryder help investigate who's faking the Charlatan's orders, Aquila emerges as one of five suspects. SAM's analysis reveals he has a fractured right arm, though it's irrelevant to the case as he doesn't fit any of the other suspect criteria that Crux gave. 
Later when Ryder determines Dorado is the impostor, Crux comms Aquila to apprehend her. Depending on how subtle the Pathfinder was in sussing out the information Aquila either moves to comply, or answers back that Dorado already left the base allegedly on the Charlatan's orders.

Trivia[]
Aquila is a constellation in Earth's celestial equator. Coming from the latin word meaning "eagle", the name is also used for a system in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3.
