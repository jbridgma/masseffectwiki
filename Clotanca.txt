Description[]
Clotanca is large but low-density terrestrial world with an atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon monoxide. Its crust is mainly composed of sulphur and unremarkable silicates. Occasional deposits of heavy metals, usually the result of meteor strikes, dot the surface.
High speed winds, powered by the hot blue star Caspian, present a constant hazard. Atmospheric entry is hazardous, and EVAs are discouraged.
