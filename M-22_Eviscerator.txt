Description[]
The Lieberschaft 2180 shotgun, or "Eviscerator," is of human civilian design and has a unique ammunition generator. Where most modern firearms shave off chips or pellets from an ammunition block, the M-22 shaves off serrated metal wedges designed to fly aerodynamically. This dramatically improves its armor-piercing capabilities, and its tight grouping helps wound ballistics at longer ranges than standard shotguns. This design also violates several intergalactic weapons treaties, so the M-22 is not distributed to militaries.

Acquisition[]
The M-22 Eviscerator is available in the Cerberus Weapon and Armor DLC pack if the Cerberus Network has been activated. 
In Legendary Edition it can be researched in the Normandy's Tech Lab at a cost of 2,500 iridium.

Squad Use[]
This weapon can be used by Grunt, Jack, Jacob and Tali.

Player Notes[]
As its in-game description explains, the Eviscerator uses default weapon range values instead of the shotgun-specific values. This means its damage modifier over distance is the same as an assault rifle's. This does not improve the shotgun's accuracy/spread at range, only the damage it can inflict.
The M-22 renders the M-23 Katana obsolete, even with its lower thermal clip capacity.
Though dealing less damage than the M-300 Claymore, this weapon has a larger magazine and deals more damage at range.
The Eviscerator is more effective against armored targets than the Geth Plasma Shotgun, which in turn is the superior choice against strong barriers and shields.

Description[]
The Lieberschaft 2180 shotgun, or "Eviscerator," is of human civilian design and has a unique ammunition generator. Where most modern firearms slice chips or pellets from an ammunition block, the M-22 shaves off serrated metal wedges designed to fly aerodynamically. This dramatically improves its armor-piercing capabilities, and its tight grouping ensures lethality at longer ranges than standard shotguns. This design violates several intergalactic weapons treaties, so the M-22 is not distributed to militaries.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
The M-22 Eviscerator can be found during the mission Grissom Academy: Emergency Evacuation, behind the barricade after the classroom. A second upgrade can sometimes be found in the security room unlocked by David Archer, if he was rescued in Overlord. It is also purchasable from Batarian State Arms post-mission if it was missed.

Multiplayer
Weapons are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The M-22 Eviscerator is categorized as uncommon and requires no multiplayer expansion packs.

Player Notes[]
While it does more damage per shot than the M-23 Katana and the M-27 Scimitar, the Eviscerator has a slower fire rate and a smaller clip.
The Eviscerator is on the lighter side for a shotgun. It weighs less than the Katana with the sacrifice of less ammunition, both in the clip, and in reserve. This weapon can still be used by a power-dependent class with a great deal of flexibility, especially when fully upgraded. While it weighs more than the Disciple, the Eviscerator does more damage and has a faster reload speed, making it superior at close-quarters. However, the M-11 Wraith is a major improvement over it in just about every way except for shot capacity, having only two shots to work with in the magazine.
Despite the description, the weapon does not have any special anti-armor or penetration abilities.
Trivia[]
There is an occasional bug associated with the Eviscerator. Sometimes when switching from the Eviscerator to a pistol or SMG, these two weapons will keep the Eviscerator's firing and reloading animations.
The M-11 Wraith is a variant of the Eviscerator.
The German-sounding "Lieberschaft" roughly translates to something along the lines of "dear shaft."
Mass Effect: Infiltrator features a model of the M-22 Eviscerator used by Randall Ezno. Unlike its Mass Effect 3 counterpart, the M-22 Eviscerator in the mobile game will generate heat instead of using thermal clips.
