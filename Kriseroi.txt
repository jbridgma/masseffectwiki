Kriseroi's worlds sport only moderate resources on average. Theonax is the exception, with particularly high amounts of platinum. 
While Neidus is habitable, nobody has settled there yet. Tenoth, Uzin, and Uzin's moon Chithess are believed to have drifted into the system at different points, though Tenoth is believed to collide with Geus in a few billion years.
