The Blood Pack control Malgus as a vorcha breeding and training ground. Travel advisories strongly recommend against civilian traffic to the system. 
Its harsh terrestrial worlds pose little problem to the vorcha and krogan, who only need breathing masks at best while other races require envirosuits. They both rate rich in resources obtainable by the Normandy SR-2, although Wrill's inhabitants are said to be making only a meager living on tin and copper deposits. The gas giant Uzin is believed to be in an unstable orbit, and may fall into Malgus after a few million years.
