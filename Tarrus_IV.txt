Assignment: UNC: Derelict Freighter







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Mass Effect[]
The Cornucopia was near the Perseus Veil when its crew discovered an artifact that apparently brainwashed them. They set a course toward the Veil, but there's no record of how the ship got back into human territory.
The derelict carries a cargo of dragon's teeth. Its crew have been all transformed into husks. 

Trivia[]
For some reason, in the map screen and save files, the Cornucopia is called 'Tarrus IV'.
