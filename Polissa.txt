Description[]
Polissa is a ringed gas giant composed of hydrogen, helium, and traces of ammonia. It has 26 moons, but the asari extracted the most valuable resource deposits from all of them long ago. The facilities have largely been forgotten in the face of greater excitement among the system's inner planets.
