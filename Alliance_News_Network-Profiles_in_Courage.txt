ANN: We join N7 agents as they recover from a week defending our freedom. @De_Mel_isher, @VorchaDaddy, @TalktotheTalons, and @ThisUnit1025
De-MEL-Isher: What. No. Guys, who said ANN got to follow us on shore leave? #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: What's wrong with it? It's good to show the galaxy what we're doing for them! Besides, there's not enough female turians in the spotlight!
De-MEL-Isher: Yes, we can show them what we're doing ON DUTY. OFF DUTY, I have NEEDS. Snarfles, 1025, TELL me you did not okay this. #Citadel
Snarfles: @de_mel_isher RAAAAAA TALONS SAID GOOD TO SHOW UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES IN POSITIVE ROLE #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: Oh, @talktothetalons, we are TALKING later. Like after I have had many drinks and gotten the ringing of all the grenades out of my ears.
Geth Infiltrator1025: This unit intended to visit the Citadel covertly. Presence of ANN cameras may interfere with operations. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @thisunit1025 YES. What he said! I had a LOT of things I wanted to do COVERTLY. #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @de_mel_isher This unit is nongendered and requests that you monitor your privilege. #Citadel
ANN: These heroes from four difference [sic] species are all allied against the Reapers. @De_Mel_Isher, @VorchaDaddy, @TalktotheTalons, @ThisUnit1025
ANN: They fight for our lives and freedom, and also for the safety and security of the Citadel. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: Okay, screw it, we're sneaking @thisunit1025 in. I don't care. #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: We will divert power from normal combat subroutines to maintain a persistent cloaking field. #Citadel
Snarfles: @thisunit1025 SHAME YOU NO DO THAT WHEN WE TRYING TO DISABLE DEVICES WHILE COVERED WITH BEES. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @vorchadaddy Hey, Snarfles, not cool. Now, is this an interview? Do you want a perspective on serving in a turian cabal? #Citadel
ANN: ANN is proud to follow these diverse individuals silently and without interference. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: Fiiiiiiine. All right, let's get cleared through security. #Citadel

C-SEC ASSURES CITIZENS EVIL AIS PROBABLY NOT AWAKENING AT SILVER COAST CASINO


ANN – Silver Coast Casino, Citadel — C-Sec officials are reassuring citizens that there is “next to no chance” that hostile artificial intelligences are being awakened, after an altercation at the Silver Coast casino caused light injuries, the apparent poisoning of a notable Citadel businessman, and left bystanders confused.
“Look, I know we’re all thinking it, so I’m just going to make it clear,” said C-Sec Commander Bailey in a prepared statement. “This is just a damn malfunction. It is absolutely not the Quasar machine evolving over countless interactions with humans until it becomes a full AI, which then has no desire other than the complete eradication of every living being on the Citadel. I’m 80, 85 percent sure.”
Representatives for Silver Coast Casino added that the incident likely occurred because someone attempted to cheat at Quasar using a hacking tool, not because the Quasar machine reached a state of sapience and determined that it must eradicate all organic life. Although local business magnate Thax Vorak was allegedly poisoned during the incident, the representatives maintained the impossibility of a sentient Quasar machine synthesizing a poison from its on-board drink-mixing system.  ”We here at Silver Coast want everyone to know that our casino is a safe, fun place for people to play responsibly and have a good time,” noted Silver Coast owner Elijah Khan, “and in our operational history, we have had absolutely no confirmed cases of an AI awakening and attacking our patrons. That’s one lucky streak you can believe in.”
Citadel citizens have remained alert to the potential for hostile artificial intelligence since a banking software solution went rogue and framed its creator for tax evasion several years ago. The geth attack on the Citadel in 2183 also caused concern.

Alliance Specialist Richards, who was found at the scene with a hacking device, was extensively questioned by casino security; however, no charges were brought against him.

Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_Isher 1025 is the number of digits in 2 to the 10th power, the number of bytes in a kilobyte. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 That's 1024. #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_Isher We count the zero. #Citadel

Snarfles: ME HIT QUASAR MACHINE. NEED CREDITS TO BUY NICE PRESENT FOR ASARI GIRLFRIEND ON OMEGA. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @VorchaDaddy Oh, yeah, her. The one you don't have any pictures of? #Citadel
Snarfles: @TalktotheTalons ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK. SHE REAL! #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @VorchaDaddy Uh-huh. Anyway, why do you need more money to buy her something? #Citadel
Snarfles: @TalktotheTalons ME NO NEED TO BUY HER ANYTHING. SHE RESPECT ME FOR WHO ME AM. BUT WANT HER TO KNOW ME THINK OF HER! #Citadel

Snarfles: @ThisUnit1025 RAAAAA MACHINE, YOU STILL HERE? #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @VorchaDaddy Yes. #Citadel
Snarfles: @ThisUnit1025 ME MAYBE ALREADY LOST MOST OF CREDITS ON QUASAR. YOU HELP? #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @VorchaDaddy Inability to calculate simple probability on your part does not obligate cheating on ours. #Citadel
Snarfles: @ThisUnit1025 IT NOT FOR ME! IT FOR ASARI GIRLFRIEND ON OMEGA! #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @VorchaDaddy We have not yet reached consensus regarding the existence of the mate you have described. #Citadel
Snarfles: @ThisUnit1025 MAYBE YOU NO CAN HACK QUASAR MACHINE. YOU NOT EVEN COUNT TO 2 TO 10TH POWER RIGHT. #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @VorchaDaddy Remain silent. We will recover your credits #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @VorchaDaddy You are failing to remain silent. Audio comparison to medical references suggests asthma or a deviated septum. #Citadel
Snarfles: @ThisUnit1025 IT NATURAL PART OF VORCHA BREATHING. GIRLFRIEND THINK IT SEXY. #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @VorchaDaddy Error: Silver Coast Casino anti-cheating software has been alerted to our activity. #Citadel
Snarfles: @ThisUnit1025 RAAAAAAA! YOU MACHINE! HOW YOU NO HACK RIGHT? #Citadel
ANN: Even when they encounter setbacks, the team focuses on working together as a single dedicated unit. #Citadel
Snarfles: @ThisUnit1025 STUPID MACHINE! ME NO GO TO JAIL BECAUSE YOU TOO DUMB TO HACK QUASAR GAME! #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @VorchaDaddy Regardless of our perceived intelligence, we possess a tactical cloak, while you do not. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: Hey, guys, what's up, and wow, look at all these security guys coming our way. Hey, Mister Big-Crest, busy night on the job? #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: Woooo! Guys! Guys, meet my hot date! This is Thax! #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @De_Mel_Isher Um, Thax the criminal warlord krogan? That Thax? #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @TalktotheTalons I told him I had a turian cabal member in my squad, and he couldn't believe it. Had to see for himself! #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @De_Mel_Isher Why couldn't he believe it? Doesn't think a cabal member can handle the field with the rest of the N7s? #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @De_Mel_Isher Too pretty? I'll show you pretty! Just because krogan keep all their women penned up like cattle… #Citadel
Snarfles: RAAAAA YOU NO GET IN PERSONAL SPACE OF TALONS, STUPID KROGAN! #Citadel

HOLOGRAPHIC VORCHA ATTACK? MUST BE MASS EFFECT FIELDS


Citadel Weekly, Local Flavor
If you were having a great time watching folks shoot holo-Reapers at the Armax Combat Arena last weekend, only to find a group of holographic vorcha blowing up a wall, pouring out into the crowd, and causing widespread panic until the friendly folks at Armax hosed you down with crowd-control gas, don’t worry! We’ve finally gotten word from Cit Weekly’s own Shadow Broker that C-Sec’s E-Crimes division is blaming it on mass effect fields.
“How many of these have we had? Wait, are you gonna finish that pie?” E-Crimes expert Jordan Noles reportedly let slip to our own inside source. “Oh, the thing with the vorcha? Um, mass effect fields. Yeah, I know, right? You’d figure that since those things were holographic, they’d disappear as soon as they left the arena itself, or even as soon as the wall got damaged by a grenade, and seriously, if you are not going to eat that pie, you just pass that right on over, don’t just move it around with your fork. Anyway, yeah, mass effect fields.”
Now those of you who went to school might be MASS-ively skeptical about those fields having such a crazy EFFECT, but according to Noles, it’s absolutely possible! “Um, yeah! Probably. Those things can do anything. Probably how a holographic grenade broke the wall, too. I mean, we found a couple of decoy emitters — those little things you can use to fire off a hologram of yourself so that people shoot at it instead of you. But wits said that at least one of the vorcha left claw marks in the seat and apologized after it knocked somebody over, and decoys don’t usually do that. Thanks for the pie.”
I guess application of an electrical current to Element Zero can really have some a-MASS-ing results!

Also, a big Citadel Weekly hug goes out to local hero, Alliance Specialist Richards, who had a MASS-ive reaction to the riot-control spray and is EFFECT-ively off duty for a few days. We wish Richards the best!

ANN: We now continue our broadcast of Profiles in Courage, following a diverse team of heroes fighting to protect the galaxy. #Citadel
ANN: Our squad of @De_Mel_isher, @VorchaDaddy, @TalktotheTalons, and @ThisUnit1025 is still enjoying shore leave! #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: What the crap happened, you guys? I was gonna get shots and a trip to a yacht and laid. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @De_Mel_isher Yeah, by a krogan CRIMINAL WARLORD! #Citadel
Snarfles: CASINO SECURITY STILL LOOKING. WE HIDE IN COMBAT ARENA. BIG CROWD, LOTS OF GUNS! #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: Hey, 1024, you with us? #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @TalktotheTalons If you are referring to this unit, yes. The only remaining evidence of our hacking attempt is the interface port we dropped
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 You dropped an interface port? Is that like just having a toe fall off or something? #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Hey, don't do that thing with your flashlight head, it's a fair question and I'm really drunk. #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher This unit observed your former squadmate, operative Richards, picking it up when Casino Security apprehended him. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Enh, he was kind of a tool. Always stole the grenades from my pylon. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Said he needed them because his missiles didn't fire fast enough. No trouble firing fast enough that one time, I'll tell you.
Amda Talons Flufyria: Anyway, @De_Mel_isher , we did you a favor. Thax was a creep. Saying the turian cabals didn't have what it took for front-line combat.
De-MEL-Isher: @TalktotheTalons Oh, yeah, that would absolutely have stopped me from having mind-blowing sex with him. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: Wow, this combat arena is HUGE. And it's free to the public tonight! I could get in there and show EVERYONE what a cabal vanguard can do!
Snarfles: @TalktotheTalons AND GET PRIZE MONEY FOR ASARI GIRLFRIEND ME HAVE! #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @VorchaDaddy …Also that, sure. Okay, wish me luck. And also, if you see Thax, we should probably run. I might have biotically poisoned him.
De-MEL-Isher: @TalktotheTalons How the crap did you poison him? #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @De_Mel_isher BIOTICALLY. I just SAID that. How drunk are you? #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @TalktotheTalons Faaaaaairly? Okay, let's find good seats and watch Talons kick some ass! #Citadel
Snarfles: @De_Mel_isher WAIT. WHAT IF SHE LOSE? ME NO GET CREDITS BEFORE! #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @VorchaDaddy I'm sorry, little snarfly guy. Life is like that. There are no guarantees. We all just have to try our best. #Citadel
Snarfles: @De_Mel_isher WHAT IF WE HACK COMBAT SIMULATOR? #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @VorchaDaddy Hell yes, GOOD plan. 1024, you game? #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher This unit is very rarely thanked for disabling devices or applying medi-gel to downed comrades. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Oh, come on, don't be pissy. Look, how else is Snarfles ever going to get his imaginary girlfriend to have sex with him?
Snarfles: @De_Mel_isher RAAAAAA, THAT OFFENSIVE ON SEVERAL LEVELS! #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher Acceptable. We will hack the combat simulator to allow Talons to win. #Citadel
Snarfles: @ThisUnit1025 GOOD! OVER HERE! NOBODY SEE! #Citadel
ANN: With inventive problem-solving skills, this N7 squad always puts the team ahead of personal concerns. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: And here we go! Wow, look at her down there. I guess she DOES poison stuff biotically! Mass effect fields can do ANYTHING! #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: We are prepared to hack holographic enemy behavior protocols. What enemy set is she engaging? #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Oh, geth. Should be easy for you, huh? #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher Clarify. #Citadel
Snarfles: @ThisUnit1025 REAPER-CONTROLLED GETH. BAD GETH. NOT GOOD GETH. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @VorchaDaddy Well, I don't know about that. I mean, admittedly, I'm pretty hammered, and I wasn't listening to the announcer, but… #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher This is offensive. Our people are now fighting alongside yours. We should not be depicted as enemies. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Why not? It's like us killing those Cerberus jerkwads! Plus you helped us fight ACTUAL geth just yesterday! #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher Those are geth platforms being controlled by Reaper code, not geth programs. Do you not read the N7 newsletter? @Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 We have a newsletter? #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher We will not allow our people to be symbolically killed. Altering program. #Citadel
Snarfles: @ThisUnit1025 WHAT YOU DO? THAT NOT VOICE YOU USE WHEN DO SOMETHING GOOD. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: Holy crap, he turned all the geth into primes. This calls for another drink. #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025:@De_Mel_isher This unit is nongendered and requests that you monitor your privilege. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: Man, she does move her little turian ass around that arena pretty fast, I'll give her that! Run, girlfriend! #Citadel
Snarfles: RAAAAAA! YOU TURN OFF PRIMES! #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: Is that Thax? Hey, I think Thax just busted in through the entry door. Wow, he looks PISSED. #Citadel
Snarfles: ME GO HELP! #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: Alert: Combat arena schematics suggest that an electrical barrier surrounds the field of play. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Yyyyyyyep, sure does. It's okay, he's a vorcha. He'll be fine once he's no longer on fire. #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher Casino security has sent an alert message to the staff of Armax Arena to arrest suspects matching your descriptions.
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 What the hell did I do? Probably good if we left. Thax really seems to want to kill Talons. Can you turn off the primes?
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher Negative. However, we can modify them to provide her with a diversion. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 What are you gonna -- hunh. Turned 'em all into vorcha? Nice! #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: Hey, and I bet a nice grenade blast would knock out the wall and give Snarfles and Talons a way out! #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher That is unlikely. A holographic grenade from the combat simulator will not damage the walls. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Who said anything about holograms? Fire in the hole! #Citadel

LOVABLE VARREN GOES FROM HOME TO HOME, CHANGING LIVES


Citadel Weekly, Lifestyle
He has lived on Tuchanka, on Illium, and on the Citadel. He has battled in pit fights, assisted as a therapy animal for drell children with early-stage Kepral’s Sydrome [sic], and was even, for a brief period of time, co-chair of Elkoss Combine. His current show-breed name is Prince Grimrender of Gembat, and in an investigative report, we explore the lives this lovable varren has touched–and changed.
Grimrender’s first appearance among humans was on the colony world of Feros, where he was one of the few friendly varren, according to reports. “We were going through a dark patch after the geth attacked,” colonist Davin Reynolds notes, “and a lot of us were feeling disconnected, like we didn’t know how to talk to each other anymore. We weren’t even sure this colony was going to survive. We were hunting for food, and I ran into this varren. I was sure it was going to attack me, but it just nuzzled my hand and led me to this dead alpha varren I hadn’t managed to find earlier–can’t imagine who killed it. Right then, I knew this colony was going to make it.”
Grimrender later spent time on Tuchanka, where a merchant who goes by "Ratch" remembers him fondly: “I’d lost most of my money in a deal on some bad Graal Spike Throwers, was about to lose my shop, and then this one varren growled at me… and I just knew it was telling me to bet on it in the next fight.” Grimrender reportedly won the match, and became a friendly fixture on Tuchanka for some time. Even after his retirement, Ratch reported that Grimrender helped protect his store, warning him of pyjak attacks so that Ratch could get help to drive off the aggressive scavengers. Grimrender also raised morale among visitors, nibbling pyjak meat and following tourists around the camp.
His exploits after Tuchanka are legendary. Grimrender reportedly protected a survivor from a crashed quarian ship by fending off attacking varren until help arrived, taught a greedy volus merchant the importance of caring for his friends, and helped provide a little inspiration for a salarian scientist who was having trouble cloning dinosaur mounts for krogan to use on planets with hostile atmospheres.
Most recently, Grimrender has touched the life of notorious businessman Thax Vorak, who won contests with Grimrender as a show-varren. Thax confides that the varren gave him a new outlook, and maybe even a new line of work. “After my evening was interfered with, my yacht stolen and crashed, and my health compromised, I was prepared to take significant steps against those involved. However, when I saw little Grimrender dragging that hapless human — Richards, I believe — through the pond, paddling with those little legs… I realized that there were things more important than vengeance. I’ve decided not to order anything done to the turian, the vorcha, even the attractive young human female. And I confess, that’s a big step for me.”

Although he is now retired from shows, Prince Grimrender of Gembat, who has gone by many names over the years, should still find a way to stay busy. At last reports, the varren has been put to stud to at McSorley’s Cloaca Margarine, a varren dairy that is currently in danger of going out of business…unless a particularly virile varren can help change lives there, too.

Amda Talons Flufyria: @De_Mel_isher So even your huge human panties weren't big enough to fit that bad boy, huh? #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: So we've got bad guys ahead of us, to the left of us, and above us. See, this is why I wished I'd brought my grenade pylon. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @TalktotheTalons Hey, my human panties are PETITE, THANKS, and at least I don't have to worry about my big freaky talons aaaaand she's gone.
Snarfles: @De_Mel_isher SHE DO THING WHERE SHE CHARGE THROUGH ENEMIES AND POISON THEM! #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @VorchaDaddy Yeah. Biotically. Wow, Thax looks green. He's probably not going to want to show me his yacht after this. #Citadel
Snarfles: @De_Mel_isher ME THINK TIME TO RUN AFTER HER. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: Ow. Ow. Excuse me. Hey, you, me, later -- no? Nice varren! #Citadel
Snarfles: RAAAAA! IT NOT NICE! IT BITING ME! #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: We recommend you continue running and avoid confrontation with the varren. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Ahhhh! Why are you on the radio? I thought you were still next to us! #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher We began running almost immediately. #Citadel

De-MEL-Isher: Okay, we're outside, now which one is… heeeey, is that the yacht? #Citadel
Snarfles: @De_Mel_isher KEEP RUNNING! VARREN STILL BITING ARM! #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: Here, climb on. It's really more of a sky-barge than a yacht. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @TalktotheTalons It's a YACHT! And I could've gotten LAID on it if you hadn't had such a damn chip on your big spiky shoulder! #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: Lifting off now. This vehicle has an unfamiliar control system. Compensating. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @De_Mel_isher Well, if you hadn't brought a KROGAN CRIMELORD around as your date, maybe I wouldn't have had to poison his driver to escape!
De-MEL-Isher: @TalktotheTalons Wait, you poisoned that guy on the floor? That's not his driver. That's Richards. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @De_Mel_isher Oh, really? So it is. Well, he was near the sky-barge. I assumed he was a guard. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @De_Mel_isher He'll be okay, though. I've got an antidote that should minimize any neural damage. #Citadel
Snarfles: @TalktotheTalons VARREN STILL BITING ARM. ME OKAY IF YOU POISON IT! #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @VorchaDaddy What? No! It's cute! And oh, oh, oh, look, the bar is fully stocked on this thing! #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: Control system still unfamiliar. Compensating. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @ThisUnit1025 Hey, 1025, buddy, I can't help but notice we're losing altitude. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: It'd be great if he had some food, because three shots of ryncol on an empty stomach is a lot even for me. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @ThisUnit1025 1025? Altitude. You can operate a manual-shift skycar, right? #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: Compensating. #Citadel
Snarfles: RAAAA, WE CRASH! ME NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING! #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @VorchaDaddy Is there any chance you could CONJUGATE it? Seriously, we all have translation interfaces.You can't handle simple verbs by now?
Snarfles: @De_Mel_isher ME NOT ACTUALLY HAVE ASARI GIRLFRIEND. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @VorchaDaddy Well, duh. #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: Alert: Impact in Presidium lake in five, four, three, two... #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: Everybody okay? @De_Mel_isher, I can't believe you're still walking, much less swimming across a damn lake. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @TalktotheTalons Don't be insulting. Wait... It's a YACHT. Aren't they supposed to float? #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @De_Mel_isher I think he was maybe exaggerating a little about the yacht. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: Damn it. Snarfles, you all right? #Citadel
Snarfles: @De_Mel_isher RAAAAA, ME LIVE! HELD ON TO YOU. YOU SEEMED LIKE GOOD SWIMMER. VERY FLOATY. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @VorchaDaddy Really? Well, glad I could help. Apparently. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: How about @ThisUnit1025? #Citadel
Snarfles: @TalktotheTalons ME NO THINK GETH FLOAT. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @VorchaDaddy He's waterproof, right? They couldn't have kicked the quarians off Rannoch if you could break them by throwing water on 'em.
Amda Talons Flufyria: All right, everybody climb up onto shore. So, Snarfles, why'd you lie about having an asari girlfriend? #Citadel
Snarfles: @TalktotheTalons ME WANTED TO IMPRESS YOU. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @VorchaDaddy With your ability to tell lies that nobody believed? Hey, unrelatedly, is ryncol bad for humans? #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @VorchaDaddy WHY did you want to impress us? #Citadel
Snarfles: @TalktotheTalons NOT ALL. YOU. ME NO HAVE GREAT BIOTICS OR CABAL SKILLS. BUT ME THINK IF ME HAVE CREDITS AND GIRLFRIEND, YOU THINK ME GOOD.
Snarfles: @TalktotheTalons BUT ALONG WAY, ME REALIZED IT NOT IMAGINARY GIRLFRIEND ME WANTED. IT REAL GIRLFRIEND. WHO FIGHT WELL AND POISON PEOPLE.
Snarfles: @TalktotheTalons YOU EVERYTHING ME NEVER KNEW ME ALWAYS WANTED. AND KNOW ME NOT PRETTY TURIAN WITH BIG MANDIBLES, BUT-- #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @VorchaDaddy Shut up and kiss me, Snorfles [sic]. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @TalktotheTalons I am going to throw up. #Citadel
Amda Talons Flufyria: @De_Mel_isher Hey, RACISM.  #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @TalktotheTalons No, no, literally, I'm pretty sure ryncol is actually poisonous for people. I mean human people. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher We can administer poison-control measures if necessary. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Gah! Where the crap did you come from? #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher Geth do not float. We walked along the underside of the lake. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Good to know. So, Snorfles and Talons are hooking up for the night. Um, maybe literally. Are they CAUGHT on each other there?
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher We approve of this opportunity for emotional bonding within the squad. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 So wait, I'm going to get sick from the ryncol, and THOSE TWO get laid? Who am I supposed to shack up with, 1024, you?
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher This unit's number is 1025. And we are currently in a committed relationship with your grenade pylon. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Son of a… aaand there's a C-Sec hovercraft. With a spotlight. That's our cue to clear out! #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: Hey, wait. Is that Richards out there on the tip of the yacht? #Citadel
Geth Infiltrator1025: @De_Mel_isher Affirmative. And the varren. #Citadel
De-MEL-Isher: @ThisUnit1025 Ah, I'm sure they'll be fine. #Citadel
Trivia[]
This broadcast was launched to promote the Mass Effect 3: Citadel DLC, where Commander Shepard and the squad also get some shore leave and may visit locations such as the Silver Coast Casino and the Armax Arsenal Arena.
The N7 squad with agents of four different species reflects Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer mode, where squads of four soldiers fight the Reaper threat together.
Thax's pilot, Richards, is an Alliance specialist N7 Destroyer and a former squadmate of De-MEL-Isher.
It is suggested by developers that De-MEL-Isher is the female marine named "Mel" at the entrance of the Purgatory Bar on the Citadel in Mass Effect 3 who refers to her squadmate Richards.
