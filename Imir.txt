Imir is a gateway system, and is classified as a G-class star.
The recycling facilities of Korlus drive much of the development in the region, though a seedy reputation does no wonders for its tourism and galactic image. Ships inbound to the system use Quodis as a discharge point, but travel advisories recommend armed escorts from the Korlus Security Fleet due to rampant piracy levels.
