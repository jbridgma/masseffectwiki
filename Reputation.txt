Reputation is a system introduced in Mass Effect 3 which affects interaction between the player character and game characters. As the player's reputation increases, characters who would otherwise ignore the player will take the player more seriously and offer different responses in dialogue. Reputation increases through completing missions and assignments in the game, as compared to Morality which is affected only by player decisions. Reputation can carry a Paragon or Renegade point increase, but it can also simply increase the size of the filled Reputation Bar, keeping the same ratio of Paragon and Renegade points. In short, reputation acts as a multiplier for the player's "alignment" and provides access to more dialogue choices and other benefits.[1] Unlike in the previous game there is no loyalty system in Mass Effect 3, but reputation serves a similar function in the sense that having sufficient reputation can have a strong influence on the fate of certain significant characters in the story.
