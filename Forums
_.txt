Main Community Forums[]
Our primary Mass Effect community forums are now here: 
    Community Forums - General discussion about Mass Effect games and the Mass Effect Wiki.
Most discussions of Mass Effect occur there; it is also a great place to ask questions and to talk informally about the wiki. In other words, for "most forum purposes" we recommend you proceed to the Community Forums.


Legacy Forums[]
Our legacy forums remain intact. The Project and Policy forums in particular are still presently used for specialized discussions.
