Exchanges personal damage and defense for a deadly robot VI.
The Salarian Architect's former colleagues at the lab he worked at are quietly relieved that he ended up in the Initiative. He is exceptionally smart, but quite quirky; he seems to get along better with his VI drones than living creatures.
The Salarian Architect joins the Nexus militia forces during the Remnant investigation APEX missions in Heleus Cluster.
