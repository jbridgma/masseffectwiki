The following information is drawn from cut content and is not to be considered canon in any way.

Mars was a major assignment and planned DLC for Mass Effect which was cancelled. It would mainly take place on the surface of Mars, within a Prothean digsite under attack.

Plotline[]
After heading toward the Bonestell Platform, Commander Shepard would receive an emergency message. On the surface of Mars, the objectives would be to secure a comm station and a Prothean dig site. Inside the latter, Shepard could access a Prothean console and secure a scientist. Later on, the surface appears to have come under siege and needs to be secured too. At the end of the assignment, the Commander is eventually faced with a choice between saving a scientist, or some research.

Trivia[]
The plot bears some resemblance to the events of the mission Priority: Mars in Mass Effect 3 since it also involves securing a Prothean digsite under attack on Mars.
Data-mining uncovered text strings for an achievement which would have been rewarded for completing this DLC: "Savior of the Ancients", whose descriptions reads: "Requirement: Resolve the situation on Mars."
