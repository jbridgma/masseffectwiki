Description[]
Ramlat is a small rock planet with a thin atmosphere of hydrogen and ethane. During the rush to exploit Camala for eezo and other minerals, Ramlat supported a small but steadily-growing population. Since the system was bereft of a significant asteroid belt, Ramlat became the go-to location for second-tier miners looking for work. Its tin and gold industry was modestly profitable before the Reaper attack; today, it is a wasteland scarred by the craters of kinetic impact weapons.
