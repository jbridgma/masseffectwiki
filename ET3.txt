The ET3 is a civilian vehicle. This six-wheeled transport has a cockpit for the driver in the right front of the vehicle. It has a cargo slot at the back for transporting up to two standard large crates. This type of vehicle, like the M29 Grizzly, is low to the ground; however, unlike that military transport, the wheels aren't covered.
The Blue Suns have one for their operations on Sanctum. Multiple vehicles are also on Haestrom, possibly brought there by the quarians during their investigation of the world's sun.
The Prothean Archives on Mars also has a few of the vehicles in its garage.
