Description[]
The sleek L-89 Halberd favors power and precision. The semi-automatic rifle was the Andromeda Initiative's attempt to make a weapon on par with the reliable M-96 Mattock that also used Initiative breakthroughs in materials science. Only a few were made but their effectiveness in the field is unquestioned. 

Features[]
The single-player Halberd can't be acquired beyond Rank I. The multiplayer Halberd has no such restrictions and can be leveled to Rank X with sufficient packs.
The multiplayer Halberd saw numerous balance changes to its damage and clip size until it settled on 117-147 and 25-32, respectively, as of the very last update. Its rate of fire changed once from 300 to 405.
