Location: Milky Way / Vallhallan Threshold / Raheel-Leyya

Description[]
The smaller pair of the binary giant system, Leyya is a young star, a BIII blue bright giant approximately 13 times the mass of Sol, and 27,500 degrees Celsius. Too hot to have any planets formed around it, Leyya will most likely nova within a short period - a few million years.

Trivia[]
Although Leyya is visible in Mass Effect 2, the star is inexplicably absent from the Raheel-Leyya system in Mass Effect 3.
