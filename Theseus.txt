Theseus is a former Prothean system. Three of its five worlds bear evidence of Prothean development. In modern times, ExoGeni Corporation has staked a claim on the ruins of Feros while the others are bereft of anything valuable, cost-ineffective for meaningful resource exploitation, or not thoroughly explored.
