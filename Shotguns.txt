Mass Effect[]
Shotguns refers to both a type of weapon and the unlockable combat-oriented talent that gives proficiency in them, available to Soldiers, Vanguards, the Krogan Battlemaster, and the Quarian Machinist.
Shotguns are particularly deadly at close range and can grant the Carnage ability by leveling up in them enough. The shotgun is stored on the small of the back in its collapsed form, below your character's assault rifle and sniper rifle. Shotguns should be monitored closely when being used as they are prone to quickly overheating.
Shotguns have a rate of fire of 0.8, i. e. one shot every 1.25 seconds.

Mass Effect 2[]
Shotguns in Mass Effect 2 are powerful close range weapons. All shotguns fire eight projectiles per shot (with the exception of the Geth Plasma Shotgun which fires three). Like all other non-heavy weapon types in Mass Effect 2 with the exception of sniper rifles, shotguns benefit from a 100% damage bonus at point-blank (melee) range. At the start of the game, the shotgun is available only to the Soldier and the Vanguard player classes, but can be chosen by any player class as a weapon specialization later in the game. The following squadmates utilize shotguns: Grunt, Jack, Jacob, and Tali.

Shotguns, heavy shotguns and assault shotguns double their rounds.
Shotgun Damage 1 - 6 (Synchronized Pulsar)

Mass Effect 3[]
Shotguns in their most conventional form fire spreads of weak projectiles, or "pellets", making them primarily geared for close encounters, though there are several shotgun models that are an exception to this, firing single slugs, explosive projectiles, or other unconventional munitions. Shotguns excel at delivering high damage in short bursts, in contrast to the sustained fire of assault rifles or submachine guns. Also, most shotguns are efficient against shielded enemies, with minimal damage lost to the shield gate mechanic.
While most shotguns lack long-range accuracy and none can utilize scopes, most can be modified for greater precision or tighter pellet spread. Unlike most other weapons, shotguns gain no increase to their accuracy from aiming down sights, with only three exceptions: the Venom Shotgun, the N7 Crusader, and the Graal Spike Thrower. No shotgun model gains any bonus to accuracy when fired from cover.
Shotguns tend towards the heavy side, though as with all the weapon classes there are exceptions less burdensome to power-oriented classes while still packing a punch.
In keeping with their close-range identity, shotguns can be modded to provide increased melee damage to the user, which can potentially be a higher boost to damage than from any other weapon type.
The following squadmates utilize shotguns: Aria, Grunt, Jack, Jacob, James, Tali, and Wrex.

Weapon Modifications[]
Main article: Mods
Mods are customizations that are exclusive to weapons only in Mass Effect: Andromeda. Mods use round-shaped sockets on a weapon and can only be changed at a Loadout terminal.

Weapon Augmentations[]
Main article: Augmentations
Augmentations are semi-permanent customizations to crafted weapons or armor in Mass Effect: Andromeda. When a weapon is created during Development (crafting), hexagonal-shaped sockets are available to add augmentations to the weapon. These augmentations cannot be changed like weapon Mods and stay part of that weapon until it is deconstructed.
