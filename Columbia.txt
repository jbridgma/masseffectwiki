Columbia has no livable planets. Its worlds are all terrestrial and rocky, and classified in extreme temperature ranges: volcanic hothouses or frigid ice wastelands. Apart from a turian telescopic array on Gromar and a Cerberus base on Nepheron, no other organization bothered to exploit the identified resources of the system.
