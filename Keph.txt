Description[]
Keph is a hydrogen-helium gas giant. Records show that the planet should have a helium-3 mining infrastructure, but scans find nothing of the sort. There are neither abnormal heat sources nor space junk from destroyed refineries. If the infrastructure was removed, it was removed entirely, and within the last few years.

Trivia[]
Unlike most other known celestial objects in the Mesopotamian-themed Ninmah Cluster, Keph appears to be named after a Hebrew word for "rock".
