Description[]
A large moon, Franklin retains a trace atmosphere of carbon dioxide, but its desolate surface holds no signs of water or life. In order to defend Watson from the pirates of the Terminus Systems, Franklin is home to two Alliance spaceports and naval bases capable of fielding six fighter squadrons each and a classified number of interplanetary ballistic missiles. Mass effect fields keep the gravity in its installations at a comfortable level for long-term living.

Trivia[]
Since the planets in the Skepsis system are probably named for famous scientists and thinkers, Franklin is possibly named after Rosalind Franklin, with the planet it orbits, Watson, possibly named after James D. Watson. The two, along with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins discovered the structure of DNA.
