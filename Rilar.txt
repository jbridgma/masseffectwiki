Description[]
Rilar is a barren, terrestrial rock world. Only a small portion of the planet has been explored, as cursory scans showed little of interest on Rilar compared to the eezo deposits on the neighboring world of Poloh Tem. The planet appears not to have garnered Reaper attention, which would make it a good rendezvous point for any scattered organic force needing to discharge their drive cores.
