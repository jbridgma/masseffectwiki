Appearances
Mass Effect: Andromeda


Quartermaster Istaal is charged with distributing weapons for the Angaran Resistance on Aya. Her depot is located next to the training ground at the Resistance Headquarters. She sells weapons as well as mods.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The quartermaster doesn't trust Pathfinder Ryder much, and tells them she's only selling because Evfra de Tershaav cleared Ryder to buy weapons over her objections. 
If the Pathfinder promises to use her wares against the kett, Istaal reminds them they're still not angara even if they have a common enemy. If Ryder's fine with her mistrust, Istaal declares she's not just following Evfra's orders. She's selling because she also respects Moshae Sjefa, whom Ryder rescued and promptly returned to Aya.
