“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Background[]
The man with a heavy Slavic accent used to be a teacher. He had a good life and he prided himself on seeing the positives and negatives right through the end. However, he disliked predictable outcomes. He joined the Andromeda Initiative to spice things up, as he feels more alive with uncertainty.

Mass Effect: Andromeda[]
Addison put Brecka in charge of the AVP system that manages colonial developments and groups of people to bring out of stasis as per Pathfinder Ryder's directives. Brecka gives Ryder a simplified analogy of how the system works: "You can't deploy an omelet without first deploying eggs. And eggs won't get you steak. Except it's people, and how all our lives begin."
Other aspects of Brecka's job involve syncing with local times on worlds detected by the Initiative (to Addison's annoyance) as well as directly bringing someone out of cryo. Ryder can ask him to revive Tech Darket Tiernan and/or Chief Engineer Grace Lito, and also Evan Kendricks.

Trivia[]
Galati is a city in Moldavia, eastern Romania.
