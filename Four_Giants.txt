Four Giants refers to the four largest rock formations among a field of rock formations on Eos. It is surrounded by The Golden Wastes, and located generally southeast of Site 1: Promise and Site 2: Resilience. Due to its small land area it is more of a landmark or drive-by scenery between more important destinations around Eos than an actual place of significance. The pillars can be explored on foot to an extent, though the top of the largest formation is inaccessible.
Pathfinder Ryder's squadmates all have their opinions regarding the natural features. The bluish-green gas prevalent in the Presson Dunes is also noticeable around the Four Giants at ground level. There is usually no wildlife around the rock formations, except for those fauna that may cross over from the Golden Wastes.
