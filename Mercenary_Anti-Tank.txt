Mercenary Anti-Tanks are mercenaries armed with assault rifles capable of firing rockets by switching fire mode.[1] Anti-Tank enemies are equipped to deal with vehicles and are typically found in merc bands and in places that need to be defended from vehicles.

Tactics[]
Because Anti-Tank Mercenaries are trained and equipped to deal with vehicles they will tend to target them. Only if there are no enemies in vehicles will they target infantry. However, their attack travels fairly slowly making it easy to dodge at long range.
The rockets do a lot of damage and have a large splash radius, but require time between shots. They are only really a threat if you are on foot, and they are always encountered in the Mako except in Pinnacle Station's Simulator
