It was Trudy Jones. She's the one who forwarded all the data about Habitat 2 to Morda. The logs don't lie.

She's no longer with us, in case you were wondering. Injured in the uprising. Not involved, just wrong place, wrong time. Stray shot to shoulder, a couple broken ribs and a concussion from a fall. Nothing lethal, all fixable. But she's dead. She rigged her analgesic delivery system to deliver a massive overdose. The last thing she did was send Morda everything she had on the planet.

Sad. Sounds like she gave up, but knew it didn't mean everyone else had to. If I had to bet on anyone to survive, it'd be the krogan.

Re: Habitat 2

I've examined the orbital scans. The scientists believe that while it would theorectically [sic] be possible to establish long-term operations, given the current planetary conditions, the costs of keeping them running would be astronomical. With the "wealth of resources" the planet has, we might just break eve. If we're lucky.

Focus on the Remnant. If you can replicate your success on Eos, and if we can secure the cooperation of the krogan, we might stand a chance here.

Memo: Andromeda Initiative Exo-Geology

In the new year, we will be joined full-time by former Valkenberg Geotech lead engineer Gertrude "Trudy" Jones. Some of you may already know Ms Jones from her stint with us this summer, during which she discovered Habitat 2. Ms. Jones will be heading a new team, which will focus solely on the study of the surface conditions of selected golden world "Habitats," in order to facilitate the development of our modular outpost prefabs.

Happy Holidays! Have a good break, you guys!

P.S.: Peppermint bark at my station. While it lasts!

New Report: Nakmor Scout Rukka

Fighting at the "flophouse." Probably over water. Some of them are trying to find another source out in the desert. Not bad of an idea, but a human in the desert, exposed, is gonna need to consume more water to start with. So where's that leave them? Probably in a worse position.

My guess is that most of them will be dead in a year. Then this entire planet's ours.
