Description[]
An unusually large terrestrial world, Arcadia has a dense atmosphere composed of nitrogen and helium. Its scorching hot surface is mainly composed of alkaline basalts, but metal deposits are plentiful.
Although several spectacular examples of columnar basalt formation offer scenic beauty, Arcadia's hostile environment has precluded commercial development.

Trivia[]
Arcadia is a region of Greece located on the Peloponnesus peninsula; in ancient times its pastoral beauty became a byword for idyllic, unspoiled wilderness.
