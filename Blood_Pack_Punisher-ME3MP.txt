Description[]
The Punisher features a secondary barrel that fires one armor-piercing round per main-barrel burst. It was developed by Blood Pack gunsmiths who found that their vorcha recruits frequently forgot to optimize ammo loads in the heat of combat. This configuration makes the process automatic and highly effective at penetrating armor.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
Available after downloading the Mass Effect 3: Firefight Pack.[1]
In Legendary Edition it is available from the Elkoss Combine Arsenal Supplies terminal in the Presidium Commons for a base amount of 10,000 credits.

Multiplayer
Weapons are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The Blood Pack Punisher is categorized as ultra-rare and requires Mass Effect 3: Reckoning.[2]

Player Notes[]
GeneralSingle-playerMultiplayer
General
Sustained, fully automatic shooting will trigger the armor-piercing round to fire every 8 rounds. The special round is indicated by a backfire effect and a sudden jolt in the weapon's recoil.
The anti-armor round will not fire if the trigger is not held down, i.e. if fired in semi-auto fashion.
The anti-armor round, despite what the in-game text may imply, does not penetrate objects or ignore enemy armor the way a piercing mod works; it simply deals bonus damage to armor protections. Since the damage of even the special round is still relatively low, armor must still be weakened in some way to maximize damage done, such as through the use of the SMG High-Velocity Barrel or powers like Warp or Cryo Blast.
The Punisher is one of the heaviest SMGs, along with the N7 Hurricane and the Collector SMG (multiplayer only). It is still light enough for a power-reliant class to use it as a primary weapon, or as a backup weapon with SMG Ultralight Materials equipped.
The Blood Pack Punisher doesn't compare that favorably with the N7 Hurricane, which has higher damage potential even against armored targets. However, the Punisher has lower muzzle climb, more accuracy, more spare thermal clips, and a lower rate of fire, which can make it a more attractive option for using in tandem with Marksman.
The Punisher will run out of thermal clips much less rapidly than the Hurricane, and it is still feasible to use it with Marksman even at long range thanks to the accuracy boosts, enabling consistent landing of shots against enemy heads and weak points. Clinging to cover and manual aim correction can compensate for the extra muzzle climb without necessarily needing the SMG Recoil System, whereas in the case of the Hurricane, recoil with Marksman active is so extreme that this mod is basically required for anything but point-blank shooting.
The SMG Magazine Upgrade or SMG Heat Sink can be used to maximize firing time.
Single-player
The Blood Pack Punisher weighs slightly less than the N7 Hurricane in single-player.
When combined with damage boosts and armor-weakening effects that can be provided by the squad such as Warp, Cryo Blast, Cryo Ammo, Warp Ammo, and Proximity Mine, the Punisher can be used with the SMG High Caliber Barrel to eat through any target with frightening speed even on Insanity difficulty. Marksman can turn it into a veritable fire hose of destruction.
Multiplayer
The Punisher's effectiveness with the Marksman power can make it a good option for the Quarian Marksman Soldier or the Turian Soldier; the latter can benefit from the stability bonuses available to the turian classes. Armor-Piercing Rounds allow for rapid takedowns of hard targets.
