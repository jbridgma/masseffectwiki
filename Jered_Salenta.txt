Jered Salenta is a cut character that was present in Mass Effect during the deleted assignment Global Plot 1. On the Citadel, he would have come to Shepard to ask for a favor.
Jered used to know Kaidan Alenko on Jump Zero, but left the Alliance after boot camp because they didn't think he had "enough skill." Later on, Jered would come to help out Lysander with treating Voids.
Somewhere on the Citadel, Jered calls out to Shepard, or to Kaidan Alenko if he's accompanying the Commander. Jered asks Shepard to help out one of his friends whose name is Lucan, who should be near the black markets in the Wards. He claims Shepard only needs to tell him that "Lysander can help." When pressed, he claims he can't go himself, or tell C-Sec, because he himself is in trouble. That's why he's asking someone he can trust like his friend Kaidan, or Kaidan's commander. If Shepard refuses to help, he remains there until you agree to help. If Shepard accepts, he says he'll meet Shepard back in the SSV Normandy's docking bay. However, as far as it is known from recovered game data, he's never seen again on the Citadel.[1]
Further during the assignment, Jered would have been seen again on Noveria as he has been trapped inside a lab flooding with toxic gas, along with other friends of Lysander's in his facility after it was raided by Vasilis.[2] If rescued in time, Jered will thank Shepard, and mention he thought Shepard was working for Vasilis.[3] If Shepard doesn't reach the lab in time or chooses to go after Vasilis directly, Lysander later implies Jered died with the rest of his friends.[4]
