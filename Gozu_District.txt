Mass Effect 2[]
For many years, the Blue Suns provided security for the residents of this district. Under their rule, this mercenary organization prevented crime and kept residents in line. Sometime in mid-2185, this situation changed as a result of outside influences. The Blue Suns came under attack from a vigilante group headed by the Archangel, and watched their numbers decline by half in Gozu as a bio-engineered plague which affected all species except humans and vorcha devastated their ranks.
In late 2185, Tarak, the leader of the Blue Suns, allied his organization with the Blood Pack and Eclipse, and planned an offensive against the Archangel from a base in the Gozu District. At the same time, a plague engineered by the Collectors was introduced into the residential blocks of the neighborhood. Omega's de facto ruler, Aria, ordered the district quarantined and placed guards to the entrances into the contaminated area. Seeing a power vacuum forming as batarian and turian members of Blue Suns began dying, the Blood Pack started to muscle its way into the district.
