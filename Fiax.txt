Description[]
Fiax is a large terrestrial planet with a frozen surface and a thin nitrogen-based atmosphere. It presented the turians with an interesting engineering challenge: how to mine its abundant heavy metals and get them off the high-gravity planet without requiring so much fuel or eezo that it ruined the profit margin. As a result, the Hierarchy heavily subsidized these mining concerns, in return for retaining large stores of gold, iridium and niobium for their strategic reserve.
Sensors report a large Reaper force of capital ships and destroyers here, which have chased off Fiax's defenders. Interestingly, they seem to have captured several of the orbital stations intact rather than turn them to slag.
