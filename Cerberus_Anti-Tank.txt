“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Cerberus Anti-Tanks are employed to defend the underground facility on Nepheron. Unlike other Cerberus forces, they are employed to defend the exterior of the Cerberus facility, rather than the interior. 

Tactics[]
Anti-Tanks are equipped with an assault rifle which has the ability to fire rockets by switching fire mode.[1] They are capable of destroying an enemy vehicle in just a few hits. Against infantry, they are just as capable because they can kill an enemy in just one or two hits. Taking down these enemies first should be a priority. 
Despite their usage of Immunity and anti-tank weaponry, it is trivial to defeat them, simply point the Mako's main gun at them, and fire. Use the jump jets to get around their missiles and keep moving.
