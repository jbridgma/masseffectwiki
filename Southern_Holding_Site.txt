The Southern Holding Site is a remote kett command center on Voeld. It lies at the southern base of the mountain where the Kett Base and Kett Tactical Operations Center are situated. To its west is the southernmost Remnant monolith on the planet, and to its southwest is a forward station site.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The base is usually heavily guarded by kett soldiers. However, if used by Andraknor as a Heskaarl proving ground it lies devoid of enemies initially unless a beacon nearby is activated, wherein waves of transports arrive at the base disgorging troops in an attempt to prevent Pathfinder Ryder from stealing its files.

Layout[]
Most of the site is exposed to the unforgiving cold of Voeld, excepting the sole semi-enclosed central building which may be used as a temporary shelter from the hazard. Its four holding cells contain lootable crates instead of angaran prisoners. There are numerous ammo supply caches scattered around the base.
The south, east, and north entrance walkways leading to the central building each have a console for securing the site's files.
