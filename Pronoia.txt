Description[]
Pronoia is a methane-ammonia gas giant, notable for the large deposits of platinum discovered by Lusia colonists on its largest moon. Asari have been selling the precious metal, used in some medical equipment, to the Sirta Foundation for less than its market value. The discount may have single-handedly saved Sirta from bankruptcy, a debt that is rapidly being repaid galaxy-wide through Sirta's humanitarian efforts. The Reaper presence in the system has no doubt cut off supplies to the foundation.

Trivia[]
Pronoia is the Greek word for "Providence" ( Greek : Πρόνοια ).
Pronoia is a neologism coined to describe a state of mind that is the opposite of paranoia. Whereas a person suffering from paranoia feels that persons or entities are conspiring against them, a person experiencing pronoia feels that the world around them conspires to do them good.
