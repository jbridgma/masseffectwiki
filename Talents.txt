Overview[]
There are 12 talents available to each class: four starting talents and eight unlockable talents. Talents that provide primarily passive bonuses to characters can also unlock further active abilities that can be used during combat; for example, Fitness can unlock Immunity. Players are also able to unlock a Specialization Class that augments their base class talent. Below is a list of talents, separated by type and accompanied by which classes can use each talent.
When Shepard commands a squad member to use one of their offensive biotic, tech, or combat-oriented talents, it takes effect as if the Commander personally had the talent. The party member need not have the usual line of sight to the intended target or target location. In this way, Shepard can take point while leaving the rest of the party safely behind.

Talent Points Leveling Progression[]
See also: Experience Guide
To advance the levels of the various talents, players are awarded 100 points between the character levels of 1-60 to place where they see fit, in addition to the 2 points that are automatically assigned to two starting abilities (one point each). 

Starting talents: For starting talents (talents that have no prerequisite to unlock), there is a cap on how many points can be allocated to a single talent at very low character levels, equal to character level plus 1. Once level 11 is reached starting talents can be maxed out with a full 12 points allocated if desired.
Unlockable talents: Talents that must first be unlocked by placing a certain number of points into a prerequisite talent are also similarly capped in terms of points that can be invested at once, only the limit begins raising starting at the first character level from which that talent can first be unlocked. Put another way, this limit is equal to character level + 1, minus the character level at which the unlockable talent first unlocks. For example, the Vanguard can first unlock Lift from Throw level 7 at character level 6. The cap on points that can be put into Lift on unlocking it at character level 6 is 6 + 1 minus 6, or 1 point maximum. Thus, Lift can first be maxed out at character level 17.
The player is automatically awarded additional training for becoming a Spectre, and gains points in Charm and Intimidate for advancing the Paragon and Renegade meters respectively. Advancing said meters can also provide unique enhancements to Shepard's combat prowess (see Morality for more details).
Each NPC squad member, on the other hand, receives 80 points between the levels of 1-60 to place where players see fit, in addition to the 2 points that are automatically assigned to two starting abilities. Points for both the player and squadmates are assigned from the Squad menu screen.
Note:  In a player's very first playthrough of the original version of Mass Effect, Shepard and NPC squadmates can only reach a maximum of level 50. It is also basically impossible to reach level 60 starting from level 1 in one playthrough of the story even once the level 50 cap no longer applies.
Legendary Edition:  In Mass Effect Legendary Edition there is no level cap on a first playthrough and experience scaling is improved in various ways to make reaching level 60 considerably easier. There is also an option to scale character levels to the 1-30 scale used in the subsequent games in the trilogy. This does not affect total talent points awarded.

Shepard:

Levels 1-5: 3 points per level
Levels 6-35: 2 points per level
Levels 36-60: 1 point per level
Total: 100 points
NPC squad members:

Levels 1-20: 2 points per level
Levels 21-60: 1 point per level
Total: 80 points
Warning:  Point assignments for both the player and squadmates can only be undone or adjusted for a character while their screen in the Squad menu is open; once it is closed or switched to a different character, chosen point allocations become completely irreversible for the rest of the current playthrough of the game's storyline. The chosen point allocations will even carry over to any future Mass Effect playthroughs with the same character. Only the talent point assignments for NPC squadmates are reset on starting a new playthrough of the story and can be reassigned differently if desired. For this reason, it is a very good idea to create permanent save points before choosing point assignments.

Class Specific[]

Class Talents[]
The following talents have the same name as each of the six playable classes. They provide bonuses that help define the unique strengths of each class, and the talents are therefore also called the "class talents". NPC squad members Ashley Williams and Kaidan Alenko share the Soldier and Sentinel class talents, respectively, but with some differences; see the pages or the  above two tables for details.

Soldier - Shepard, Ashley Williams
Engineer - Shepard
Adept - Shepard
Sentinel - Shepard, Kaidan Alenko
Infiltrator - Shepard
Vanguard - Shepard
Squad Member Class Talents[]
The following class talents are found only on NPC squad members. See the links or the table above for details.

Quarian Machinist - Tali'Zorah nar Rayya
Asari Scientist - Liara T'Soni
Krogan Battlemaster - Urdnot Wrex
Turian Agent - Garrus Vakarian
Specialization Classes[]
Class specializations are unlocked once assignment UNC: Rogue VI on Luna is completed. There are six specializations in total, two possible for each class of which one must be chosen. Selecting a specialization offers access to a new trait that add ranks 7-12 to your base class-specific talent; ranks 1-6 are unchanged, and grant the same bonus when you take ranks 7-12. Specializations are only unlocked once per player character and will carry over to subsequent playthroughs with that character, so choose carefully and create a save point beforehand in case you get buyer's remorse. Specializations are not available for NPC squad members.

Bonus Talents[]
See also: Weapon and Ability Achievements Guide
If the player is creating a second character, any unlocked bonus talents may be selected. These talents are unlocked by gaining the achievement for each talent. The player can choose one additional talent to add to their skill base. This talent is not reliant upon the existing class or even usual prerequisite talents. For example, a Soldier can choose Medicine as a bonus talent and put points into it immediately, even though it must usually be unlocked by first putting points into First Aid on the classes that have Medicine by default. A weapon talent such as Assault Rifles can also be chosen if the chosen class doesn't already possess it.
Bonus talent abilities do not benefit from normal class bonuses. For example, Singularity on a Bastion Sentinel receives no bonus to recharge times at all; neither will its duration be increased on a Nemesis Vanguard.
The following 15 bonus talents can be unlocked:

Shotguns
Assault Rifles
Sniper Rifles
Lift
Throw
Warp
Singularity
Barrier
Stasis
Damping
Hacking
Electronics
Decryption
Medicine
First Aid
