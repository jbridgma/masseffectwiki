Description[]
Uwan Oche ("Uwan Prime") is a stony planet encased in ice under a methane-heavy sky. Named for the Uwan Consortium, the batarian manufacturing firm that financed its exploration, Uwan Oche's crust provides much of the boron allotropes used in omni-gel throughout the Terminus Systems. The area has naturally become a haven for pirates, who attempt to steal the refined gel or its ingredients as soon as the cargo ships leave the atmosphere.
