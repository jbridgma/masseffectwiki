 Phoenix Armor is manufactured by Sirta Foundation and as such regenerates the wearer's health thanks to its medical VI.[1] Relatively inexpensive, it has reasonable shields but offers little damage protection; while a decent armor in the early stages, it is quickly superseded by Colossus Armor or Predator Armor. 
Phoenix Armor is available for humans, quarians, turians and krogan. It is made distinctive by its pink-and-white colouring and is Ashley Williams' default armor.

Trivia[]
      
The Phoenix armor and helmet are available to purchase separately for your Xbox Live Avatar. Titled "Ashley's Armor" and "Ashley's Helmet" in the Avatar Store, they sell for US $3.99 and $1.99, respectively.
The Phoenix armor was designed by Matt Rhodes and was originally considered to be Commander Shepard's main armor. More information on its development can be found here on images 6, 8 and 26.
