The Geth Sapper is a type of Geth Hopper used by the geth followers of Saren Arterius. Sapper platforms are predominantly white with darkened extremities. 
The Sapper's main eye gun deals toxic damage. Compared to other Hoppers, it relies more on its weapon and serves as an assault agility platform.

Tactics[]
Like all Geth Hoppers, Geth Sappers are lightweight and lightly armored, making them vulnerable to gunfire. The problem is getting them to hold still long enough for a clear shot. Happily, they are usually encountered indoors, and a Hopper usually leaps back and forth between two positions across a room, allowing you to hit them on their return jump.
Physics-based biotic attacks, especially Throw, will inflict heavy damage against Stalkers. Lift works nicely to hold them in midair, especially if you're using a sniper rifle.
