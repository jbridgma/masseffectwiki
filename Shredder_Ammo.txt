Player Notes[]
Shredder Ammo has the highest damage bonus of all ammo powers, but enemies must be organic and have their protections stripped away first, since the damage bonus only applies to the red health bar. Because of this, Shredder Ammo is less versatile than other ammo powers that provide multiple bonuses. It is most useful on lower difficulties, as most organics would lack additional protection. Players on higher difficulties can still benefit from its sizable damage bonus when fighting enemies with weak protections, like vorcha or varren; or enemies with substantial health, like krogan.
Putting Shredder Ammo on a powerful weapon, like the M-12 Locust, and using it against frozen or ragdolled enemies can make short work of powerful enemies like krogan, even on higher difficulty levels.
Shredder Ammo can be a great "one-point wonder" power, providing a sizeable 40% damage boost to organic targets with a minimal investment of squad points.
