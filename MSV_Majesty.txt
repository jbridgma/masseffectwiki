The ship went missing while running a job for Synthetic Insights, Ltd. Captain Willem's brother, Garoth, filed a report to Synthetic Insights on Noveria requesting an inquiry on the ship's whereabouts, though the note was only forwarded to Administrator Anoleis.
Commander Shepard can discover the ship's fate. It has been waylaid by privateers and left adrift near Xawin. Captain Willem was killed and his body was taken down to the mercenary base on the planet.
