Description[]
Visible in Invictus' night sky is Temerarus, a planet named for the turian spirit said to have inspired the crew of their first manned moon launch. A boiling hot rock planet, Temerarus is much hotter than its temperate neighbor due to a thick atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide and helium. Its hot surface is largely composed of boron. Surrounded by a thick dust cloud, Temerarus is often struck by small meteors, making exploration dangerous.

Trivia[]
Temerarus in Latin roughly translates as "bold" or "rash", in reference to the spirit of turian boldness that inspired the turians' first manned moon launch.
