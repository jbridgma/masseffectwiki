Research Technicians are people who are employed by Cerberus to conduct research at the various installations utilized by the organization. Technicians are biotics and are also armed with pistols.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Technicians are conducting research at various installations on Binthu. They are conducting research on organisms like Rachni Workers, Rachni Soldiers, and Thorian Creepers for unknown reasons.

Tactics[]
Technicians tend to deploy their their biotics on first salvo, using their pistols to deal covering fire until their talents cool down.
Due to the room setup on the Binthu labs and the obscuring forcefields at their centers, it is possible to sneak up on the technician (and other Cerberus personnel), allowing for shock-and-awe first strike scenarios.
Legendary Edition:  Unlike most biotic enemies in Legendary Edition, Research Technicians can still target Shepard with their disabler Throws.
