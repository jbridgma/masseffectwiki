Description[]
A hydrogen-helium gas giant believed to have entered Amun's system within the last billion years, Sekhmet was the site of an important battle in the Anhur Rebellions. When the Eclipse mercenary company sought to capture the refueling stations to deny the rebels supplies, a fighter wing hiding in Sekhmet's rings ambushed them. Eclipse suffered heavy initial losses but destroyed two rebel carriers and forced them to retreat into FTL. This was considered the "high water mark" of the rebellion: at no point after the battle of Sekhmet did the rebels have a victory.
Today Sekhmet is home to refueling stations and a small war memorial in orbit at the planet's L5 Lagrange point.
