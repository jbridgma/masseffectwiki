Description[]
Yukawa is a small rock planet with a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide. After a labor dispute with companies shipping metallic asteroids to the nearby Arcturus system, Yukawa's iron core and blanket of hematite were briefly mined to aid in the construction of Arcturus Station. Yukawa's reputation as "the scab planet" persists to this day, as its other resources are not particularly notable.

Trivia[]
Yukawa is possibly named for Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa.
