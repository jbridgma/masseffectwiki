Description[]
A habitable planet known for its arid sulfurous deserts, Asteria is colonized near the poles to avoid the uncomfortable temperatures that can reach 65 degrees Celsius in more southern latitudes. While the seas contain primitive animal life, little of it can live on land, leaving the soil to hardy plants that can survive in the extreme heat. Asteria is home to thriving human and asari agrarian colonies but little in the way of manufacturing or mining.
TRAVEL ADVISORY: Carbon dioxide concentrations can reach 2,500 parts per million in Asteria's atmosphere. Citizens should carry supplemental oxygen for children and the elderly. Consult with local governments to discuss animal companion detection systems or other preparatory measures.
ALLIANCE BULLETIN: Geth have been encountered in the Hekate system. All civilian traffic is prohibited.

Trivia[]
Asteria is listed in the official game guide for Mass Effect 2 and is mentioned in the codex entry for Bothros, a planet in the Hekate system, as one of its neighbors, but it does not appear on the galaxy map. The planet is present in the Hekate system in Mass Effect 3.
Asteria ("starry one") was a name attributed to eleven individuals in Greek mythology.
Blackdamp is a mixture of unbreathable gases left after oxygen is removed from the air and typically consists of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapour.
