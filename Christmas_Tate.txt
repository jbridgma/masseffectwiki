Christmas Tate is a colonist of the Andromeda Initiative. He is a former member of Mining Company 07 that mined element zero on Mars. 







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




If Pathfinder Ryder manages to settle Kadara, Christmas Tate becomes the mayor of the Initiative's Outpost Ditaeon on the planet Kadara. He runs the outpost alongside former colleagues from Mining Company 07. Their role is to collect the sulfur located in Kadara's bedrock to produce fertilizer for the Initiative.
At 61 years old, Christmas remarks that he is the oldest of all the outpost leaders. He thinks himself to be an honest person and therefore doesn't like to work with Kadara's dubious organizations. Nevertheless, he thinks that his honesty will do some good on the planet. He actually hired some Exiles from the planet to give them a second chance.
Christmas may ask Ryder to investigate a harmless cult that worships a massive machine, called 'Old Skinner', that worries him. Ryder may take care of the situation and the report back to Christmas.
Christmas' mother was called Holiday Tate, which he suggests explains his relatively unusual forename.
