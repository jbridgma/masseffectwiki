Mass Effect[]
Pistols refers to both a type of weapon and the talent that gives proficiency in them. Pistols are close- and mid-range weapons designed for a variety of situations, particularly shooting on the move. They lack the automatic fire of assault rifles, and do less damage compared to shotguns or sniper rifles.
This talent is available to all classes except Sentinels, who get bonuses to pistol proficiency from their class skill, Asari Scientist, who has no weapon talents whatsoever, and Krogan Battlemaster and Turian Agent, which instead use assault rifles as their "basic" weapon.
However, even with a low number of points or none whatsoever, pistols are significantly more accurate than any of the other weapons. For this reason they are generally reserved as backup weapons for biotic and tech specialists as their main skills recharge. Moreover their high accuracy, particularly in the early levels, should not be overlooked by Soldiers as an alternative to assault rifles, especially if the Shotgun talent is going to gain investment much later in the game.
Pistols have a rate of fire of 4 shots per second. When Master Marksman is active, they will out-perform assault rifles of the same rank.

Mass Effect: Andromeda[]

A mixture of "hand cannons" and submachine guns (SMGs), pistols are generally the lightest weapons on the battlefield. This light weight allows more frequent use of powers. Single-shot pistols tend to be more effective against armor than SMGs but require careful aim. 
In Mass Effect: Andromeda, Pistols and Submachine Guns (SMGs) were combined into a single Pistols category.

Even if the in-game names and descriptions of some weapons specifically call out the weapon as an SMG (e.g. Charger), the weapon is classified as a "Pistol".
The "Heavy" designation seen in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 that was used for pistols was dropped in Mass Effect: Andromeda.

Pistols Customization[]
Pistols can be customized by two different methods in Mass Effect: Andromeda. 

Weapon Modifications[]
Main article: Mods
Mods are customizations that are exclusive to weapons only in Mass Effect: Andromeda. Mods use round-shaped sockets on a weapon and can only be changed at a Loadout terminal.

Weapon Augmentations[]
Main article: Augmentations
Augmentations are semi-permanent customizations to crafted weapons or armor in Mass Effect: Andromeda. When a weapon is created during Development (crafting), hexagonal-shaped sockets are available to add augmentations to the weapon. These augmentations cannot be changed like weapon Mods and stay part of that weapon until it is deconstructed.
