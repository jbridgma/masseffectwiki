Gender
Female


Appearances
Mass Effect: Andromeda


Yveth is a merchant on Aya. She typically sells consumables and resources, as well as Remnant Decryption Keys and the Remnant Fighter Model, on the Marketplace.
Yveth can be overheard conversing with an engineer who's overjoyed over her former mentor Moshae Sjefa's return. The engineer claims Nalon saw the Moshae heading out over some business with Pathfinder Ryder, and the merchant is curious as to what that might be.
If Ryder talks to her, Yveth assures them their credits will do fine as long as they don't start any trouble. She doesn't have a good grasp of human idioms as she doesn't know what "poster child for no trouble" means, though she can work with that.
