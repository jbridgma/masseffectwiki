Batarian Engineers are the tech experts of a batarian squad. They have heavy shielding, can use tech powers like Overload, Sabotage, and Neural Shock, but are only equipped with pistols.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




During the mission to stop batarians from crashing an asteroid into the human colony of Terra Nova, Engineers are deployed in the interior of the fusion torch stations and the main facility to deal with tech problems and reinforce their allies.

Tactics[]
Engineers will not be the first troopers in combat since they tend to stay behind cover and use their powers to support their allies. They will use their pistol to attack between salvos of their tech proximity mines, which they use to debuff enemies and wear them down from a distance.
