Walkthrough[]
Speak to the Warden[]
The Warden is in the Kadara Slums guarding the entrance to the badlands. The last time he saw Remi, she was with Johan and his crew - a nasty bunch. You get the navpoint  for their last known location.

Travel to the navpoint[]
The navpoint leads to the far southeast of the map in the Spirits' Ledge region. Head southeast of the Forward Station in the area and the mission updates to the next objective when you approach.

Defeat Johan and his gang of exiles[]
Johan and his group will come out of the building to attack. Defeat them and then head into their base.

Find Remi[]
Remi is in a locked prison cell in the building. On the floor are several dead bodies. Scanning them reveals that some of the organs are missing and that they died from blood loss. Scanning a frying pan reveals that it was used for cooking human flesh.

Free Remi[]
Release Remi from her cell by using the Cell Control Panel. 

Speak to Remi[]
Remi says they were going to eat her like they did with the others. Ryder contacts Grayson over the comm and he is sending a shuttle to pick her up and bring her back to Kadara Port. She is no longer exiled to the badlands. If you sided with the Collective Ryder asks Suvi to contact them to send a shuttle.

Aftermath[]
If you return to Grayson Wessler, he says that Remi is back in her home, and that he is personally paying for several months of her protection fee.
