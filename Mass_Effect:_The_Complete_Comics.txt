There are currently eleven comics set in the Mass Effect universe. As the games are considered to be the player's story, almost none of the comics, like the novels, feature player characters like Commander Shepard as the main character. The sole exceptions are Mass Effect: Genesis, Mass Effect: Genesis 2, and two issues of Mass Effect: Foundation. The first two, being interactive, allow the player to control Shepard's decisions, while the Foundation issues tell a story about Mass Effect Galaxy protagonist Jacob Taylor.
While all of the non-interactive comics released so far have varying authors and artists, all of them are colored by Michael Atiyeh.
