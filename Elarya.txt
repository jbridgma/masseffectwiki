Elarya is a character cut from Mass Effect during the deleted assignment Global Plot 3. She is an asari diplomat on the Citadel who tasks Shepard with recovering a missing asari scientist.
After Shepard is tasked with visiting her, Elarya gets straight to the point in the Commander's presence. A renowned asari scientist has gone missing in the Attican Traverse, in the middle of hanar territory, and they are suspiciously silent about it. Elarya provides Shepard with a bit of Dr. Euthalia's background, then sends the Spectre to check out her ship's last known coordinates. During the conversation, Shepard may also refuse the assignment, or scold the asari for sending out Euthalia without protection, to which Elarya responds that they haven't heard of any threats in that specific region, and they also thought her trip to the hanar colony would be an opportunity to learn more about remote colonies.[1]
After hearing Euthalia's ship's transmission to the hanar colony, Shepard may go back to Elarya to inform her of it, but she won't have anything new to say as long as the doctor hasn't been recovered.[2]
Once that's done, Elarya offers credits to the Commander for accomplishing the mission. She also informs Shepard that the asari had no idea about the conflict between the hanar and the lystheni. If Shepard has started the peace process with the hanar senator, she also offers a "bonus" for it. Afterwards, if interacted with again, she simply states she has no more work for the Spectre.[3]
