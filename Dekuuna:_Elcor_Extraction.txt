The elcor have requested an emergency extraction for warriors and civilians trapped on their homeworld of Dekuuna. Search for survivors on Dekuuna, rescue them if possible, and return to the elcor ambassador.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: Rannoch

Go to the Citadel Embassies floor on the Presidium and speak to the elcor ambassador after exiting the elevator, close to the stairs. Morality points are additionally available regardless of how you respond.

Walkthrough[]

This is a standard Search and Rescue mission. Dekuuna is located in the Phontes System in the Silean Nebula. Merely searching between Dekuuna and its moon Oltan will reveal the Elcor Flotilla at the moon and the Code of the Ancients on Dekuuna itself. Despite this mission's name and journal description, scanning and retrieving the flotilla from Oltan is all that's required to complete it; Dekuuna itself can technically be ignored. 
Return to the Citadel and speak to the diplomat again to finish the mission. The elcor were able to evacuate, but the ambassador doesn't bother giving prefixes to emphasize how many civilians escaped: "Not enough." Completing the mission gives you 5 Reputation and 120 experience. 
Note:  It is possible to obtain the flotilla before getting the journal parameters. The first conversation with the ambassador will still be the mission acquisition dialogue but you won't be able to speak to him about the asset right away. Simply reload the Embassies map by save/reload or by elevator joyride to update the ambassador's lines and conclude the mission.
Legendary Edition:  The Elcor Flotilla asset now requires you to obtain this mission first. It won't appear in the scans if you look for it on Oltan without speaking to the ambassador.
