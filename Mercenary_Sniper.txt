Mercenary Snipers are mercenaries that are geared for long-range combat, armed with a sniper rifle and a pistol sidearm. The mercenary bands will position them behind regular mercenaries or on top of towers and other elevations to keep them out of harm's way.

Tactics[]
Snipers will have between 1 to 4 bars of shielding depending on the location and the difficulty. As is the case with all ME enemies, their shielding regenerates over time. Their health will slowly regenerate as well and some of them will have the Immunity ability for further protection.
Their Assassination ability is very dangerous and can instantly take out a low-level Shepard and do considerable damage to the Mako. It will always be preceded by a laser targeting beam, so make sure not to leave cover for long until you've dealt with them. It is possible to interrupt Assassination by overheating the rifle with Sabotage, disabling the sniper with Lift, or killing said sniper before the sniper fires.
These snipers will switch to pistols at short range or if you Sabotage their weapons, becoming less dangerous. When encountered outside, Soldiers and Infiltrators can do pre-emptive sniping against these enemies if they stay out of their line-of-sight. Using Mako will make combat much easier, but result in lower experience gain.
