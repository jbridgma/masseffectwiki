Description[]
Massive silicate-filled dust storms plague the surface of Lahu. In an odd partnership of commerce and science, high-rolling volus casinos on Oma Ker entered a partnership with the scientific research teams whose observation satellites watch over Lahu. The casinos took bets on how long Lahu storms would last and how high their wind speed might climb. Payouts made the rare volus rich, with jackpot winners forming a small fraternal order.
The Reapers have destroyed the satellites.
