Description[]
Raysha is a standard hydrogen-helium gas giant with traces of sodium and ammonia in its atmosphere.
During the brief "gold rush" to Klensal, a few companies established an infrastructural [sic] for helium-3 skimming and deuterium mining on Raysha's icy moons. When Klensal proved to be less wealthy than expected, the facilities were stripped for parts and abandoned.

Survey Text[]

“Scans of the planet Raysha revealed an old unmanned shuttle. Your salvage team found turian goods on board, all marked with the Tridend Colony insignia.”

Trivia[]
Raysha is too small to be a "standard hydrogen-helium gas giant" (William Hubbard, The New Solar System 4th ed, 1999; p. 194). It is more likely an "ice giant" like Neptune or Gliese 436 b.
