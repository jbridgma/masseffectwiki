Description[]
A sizable hydrogen-nitrogen gas giant just on the far side of its pale yellow star's "frost line," Dranen is known for its spectacular storms. At least three persistent observable "spots" -- actually cyclonic and anticyclonic storms -- have lasted for over 544 years, significantly longer than Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The largest of these spots, the Ishna, has consistently held a diameter over three times that of Earth.
Dranen has 44 moons. Two of them are of special interest to the Citadel Committee on Habitable Worlds. The first, Arvuna, is a life-bearing world that has already been colonized. The second, Alahya, is slowly being terraformed into an ammonia-based world for volus populations.

Trivia[]
The moon of Arvuna doesn't appear in the final version of Mass Effect 2, even though it has a description and statistics listed in the official Mass Effect 2 guide book, but it is added in Mass Effect 3 with the Mass Effect 3: Leviathan DLC.
