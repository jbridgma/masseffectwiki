Player Notes[]
This power functions like a Tech version of Shockwave, both in form and the ability to hit enemies behind cover or on the other side of walls. Using this to your advantage is wise when considering the brief activation and the Shadow's comparatively low durability. Powers, weapon mods, or gear that can enable seeing enemies through terrain can make Electric Slash more effective.
Before the "shockwave" portion of the power launches, there is an initial "hit" that occurs directly in front of the the user right after casting the ability when the sword is swung.
Like Shockwave, this power is capable of knocking most unprotected (red bar) infantry targets off their feet; the force can stagger almost any protected target, even heavier armored enemies.
Both the slashing portion and the cascading projectiles can hit up to 3 enemies each, for up to 6 enemies in total.
The user moves forward slightly while casting Electric Slash, so caution should be used near drops and ledges as the user can fall off.
Unlike Shockwave, Electric Slash may not be angled to hit enemies at different elevations, except when enemies are "locked", or highlighted, in the HUD; i.e. if they are obscured by terrain the power can't be aimed up or down at them.
Electric Slash can detonate all three types of "tech" Power Combos (fire, cryo, tech) and is one of the only powers that has an evolution to enhance the damage of such combos. The Shadow can only prime such combos itself through the Rank 5 Electric Damage evolution of Shadow Strike or the use of appropriate ammo mods, so teaming up with allies with tech combo primers like Incinerate is desirable.
Electric Slash is able to detonate the fuel tanks of Geth Pyros if it is a killing blow.
The long casting animation means caution should be used around dangerous enemies that can rapidly close to melee range, such as Abominations, Brutes, and teleporting Banshees.
If Electric Slash is cancelled with a dodge before the projectiles are launched, a cooldown will not be triggered. Furthermore, Tactical Cloak will also not be broken if the power is cancelled in such a manner.
Availability[]
Single-player: N/A
Multiplayer: N7 Shadow Infiltrator
Bugs[]
The rank 5 Detonate evolution is bugged and does not provide any additional damage to any Power Combos detonated by Electric Slash.[1]
