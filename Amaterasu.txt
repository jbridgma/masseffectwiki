Amaterasu is a human colony, home to Ashley Williams' mother and sisters. It lies about a dozen light-years from the Czarnobóg Fleet Depot and is one of the smaller Alliance colonies. In 2181, Ashley took a week of extraordinary leave to return home to take care of her youngest sister, Sarah.
Amaterasu is a terminus on the Illium-Amaterasu shipping lane. In 2185, as security advisories are being issued against travel to human colonies, none are issued for Amaterasu, possibly due to its proximity to an Alliance base.

Trivia[]
Amaterasu is likely named after the sun goddess Amaterasu, one of the main deities of Shintoism.
Czarnobóg is the modern Polish word for Chernobog, a black god of Slavic mythology.
