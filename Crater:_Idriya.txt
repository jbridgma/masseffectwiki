Crater: Idriya is an abandoned mining camp on H-047c, believed to have been a former angaran mine. It is located far southwest of the Tempest, at the end of a vehicle trail southwest of the Forward Station near the yellow-lighted bridge connecting the southwest landmass to the southeast landmass. Along with Crater: Santiago, Idriya is a major point of interest that does not appear in maps of the world.
The dome interior only consists of a single locked building. Topside at the back of the building is an Adapted Initiative Core Tech and a lootable container.






“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The mining camp only appears empty and locked most of the time. Much of the facility is underground. It becomes explorable once Pathfinder Ryder agrees to investigate Sid's case of missing settlers.
