Thal's development is largely due to the settlement of independent turians on Altakiril. They built secret installations on Xerceo's moons. Resource exploitation is low due to cost-ineffective methods, though there is some interest terraforming Sarait.
By 2186, most traces of civilization in the system have been wiped out by the Reapers.
