The Lethe Rift is the gigantic geological depression bisecting most of the notable regions in H-047c. It is bounded to the south by Acheron Spine and unmarked territory everywhere else. 
Three bridges have been erected to complete a circular vehicle trail in the three landmasses surrounding the Lethe Rift, though the southernmost one connecting the southwest and southeast portions is the only bridge that's actually within the jurisdiction of the rift. One bridge connects the northwest and southwest land portions, while the other connects the Cocytus Plateau to the northwest land portion. They can be identified by the color of lights on towers on both ends: the southern bridge has yellow lights, the western bridge has green lights, and the eastern bridge has red lights.
The rift is notable chiefly for being one of the few regions in the Heleus Cluster where it's feasible to test how far the Nomad can "glide" without plummeting to its depths. It's also one of the few places where the normally intrepid squadmates of Pathfinder Ryder scream in terror whenever the Pathfinder drives the Nomad dangerously close to the cliffs.

Lethe is the river of forgetfulness in the underworld of Greek mythology.
