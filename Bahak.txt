Prerequisite: Arrival (Mass Effect 2)


Despite a vigorous colonization push by the batarians, Bahak boasts only moderate amounts of resources. It is, however, located close enough to Alliance space that military buildups here are a concern.
Because Bahak is a batarian territory, Alliance ships (and even independent vessels with similar profiles) are unwelcome. Ubiquitous spy satellites ensure the need for stealth systems should undesirables desire to enter the system.
The system has exactly 304,942 inhabitants, according to Project Control data aboard the Project Base.
