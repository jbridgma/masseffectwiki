Description[]
Katebolo is a relatively large methane-ammonia ice giant. Although Cyone and its orbital stations offer military-grade starship fuel, commercial ships took advantage of the helium-3 refineries here. Because Katebolo was relatively near to the mass relay in the system, the Reapers destroyed the infrastructure on their way to more important targets.
