Niilj is an Angaran Resistance operative on Voeld. He's also known by the code name "Shavod-Gaan", or "Whisper".







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Background[]
According to his sister Buxil, Niilj's "Shavod-Gaan" moniker is ironic given that he was loudmouthed when they were children.
Niilj has a reputation for being one of the best agents in the Resistance. His squad completed dozens of missions and accounted for hundreds of kett kills. However, he and his team were captured by the kett while attempting to infiltrate their command center. They were taken to the Northern Holding Site prior to extraction. His nephew Skeot received word of his capture, and attempted to mount a rescue for him.

Mass Effect: Andromeda[]
Pathfinder Ryder can liberate Niilj and his crew after learning about him from Skeot, or by discovering the holding site independently while exploring Voeld. Once their guards are all slain he asks Ryder how they were found, though the specifics don't matter as he and his team still need to hand over a data drive containing stolen kett secrets to Buxil on Techiix. Niilj figures Ryder is an ally since he rescued them, so he's willing to trust the stranger with the delivery of the drive.
Niilj then departs for the Angaran Resistance Base, briefly stopping over at Hjara Station to inform Skeot about Ryder's role freeing him and the others.
Sometime after, Niilj departs Voeld on a time-sensitive mission from Commander Anjik Do Xeel without bothering to message Buxil about his freedom.
