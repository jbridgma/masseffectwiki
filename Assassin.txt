Assassins are individuals who have been hired by others to kill a specific target. These people are usually equipped with pistols in order to keep a low profile.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




If Shepard decides to go looking for Harkin first, rather than going to see Barla Von, when the Commander tries to enter Chora's Den for the first time, two Assassins will be waiting in ambush.
Saren and Fist hired some Assassins to take out Tali'Zorah nar Rayya to prevent her from giving her acquired data that will expose Saren as a traitor. They set up a situation where Fist said that Tali would meet the Shadow Broker but it was a trap. Shepard and the squad arrive just in time to save her. 

Tactics[]
Because of the area that these enemies are faced, they are in a confined space that offers little cover. However, these enemies don't have much in the way of shields or health, so they shouldn't put up too much of a fight. They are only lightly armed so you don't need to worry about them ripping through your shields too quickly. Keep in what cover you have and you should have no problem taking them out.
The turian assassin that you encounter confronting Tali is notability stronger than the turians you may have fought earlier, or the salarians accompanying him. He has higher health and shields than them, being roughly equal combat-wise to a Pirate, is armed with a shotgun, and can use Carnage.
Tali actually will fight during your second encounter with the assassins, armed with a shotgun and Tech proximity mines. As the two salarian assassins are in close proximity to her and both have low health, she'll usually take out one or both of them after a minute of fighting if you do not intervene, which is mildly helpful on higher difficulties.
