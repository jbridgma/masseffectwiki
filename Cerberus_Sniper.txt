Cerberus Snipers are individuals who are employed by Cerberus to defend installations and research facilities. 







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Cerberus Snipers are employed to defend key installations on Binthu and Nepheron that are conducting research on various organisms like Rachni Workers, Rachni Soldiers, and Thorian Creepers. Snipers are employed to defend the exterior and interior of the installations.

Tactics[]
Snipers are armed with a sniper rifle and will prefer to keep their distance from their enemies. They do use the Assassination ability often to take down their enemies, but since there is a red sighting laser, that makes it easy to dodge. Snipers will always keep their distance and usually require biotic or tech attacks to get them out.
