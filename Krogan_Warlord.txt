Krogan Warlords are krogan that have allied themselves with Saren.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Warlords are often seen commanding other krogan forces, or commanding geth forces that have allied themselves with Saren. Warlords are tougher than the average krogan enemies and should be treated appropriately. While they do not have the biotic powers that Krogan Battlemasters have, they are still dangerous in the areas of weapons and melee attacks.

Tactics[]
Krogan Warlords like to charge more frequently than the rest of their counterparts, and use their melee attacks to end fights. Therefore, it is advisable that you take them down before they have a chance to do this. Also using biotics while they are charging, particularly Lift, will give you some breathing room and depending on where you are, could send a krogan off a cliff, over a railing, or so far up in the air, that when they come back down, the impact will kill them.
Warlords favor assault rifles over very long ranges, and will switch to shotguns and charge once a target is within their considerably large charging range.
Because they have more health and shielding than their krogan counterparts, you may want to focus on them before taking out the rest of the krogan, or other enemies in the room. Like all krogan, they will regenerate once before dropping for a final time if they are not killed whilst in the air, or by certain ammunition/grenades that destroys targets upon killing them (like incendiary, toxic, or high explosive).
