In Mass Effect 3, Commander Shepard's armor can be customized by swapping out pieces of the default N7 Armor for pieces purchased from merchants, found on missions, or made available as downloadable content, by using the armor locker aboard the Normandy SR-2. Not just augmenting the armor's physical appearance, these pieces also have varying effects on various aspects of Shepard's combat effectiveness. Additionally, the player can further customize the armor's appearance by changing its color, reflectiveness, applying a pattern, applying two different tints, and adjusting the color of any lights.
As well as individually customizable pieces, it's also possible to equip Shepard with full sets of armor that provide specific bonuses. These sets can't have individual pieces swapped out, but they can provide unique combinations of bonuses that can't be had from mixing and matching pieces alone.
In addition to the many available options for Shepard's armor, the Commander can choose from a selection of casual outfits to wear when armor is not required.

Securitel Helmet



The Securitel Helmet was originally designed as riot-gear. It is covered in ablative plating, well-padded to lessen damage from shocks, blows and bullet impacts.

Delumcore Overlay



Developed by Delumcore Systems, a VI inside this headgear enhances aim when targeting an enemy's vulnerable points. It also maximizes armor-cell efficiency, feeding excess power to weapon systems. The overlay's VI originally reported the wearer's combat status out loud, but this system was scrapped after testers called it "intrusive," "talky," and "kind of moody."
