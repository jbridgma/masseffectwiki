Defensive Turrets are turrets that Fist has installed and concealed in his VIP room. 







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




When Shepard and the squad eventually fight their way through Chora's Den to get to Fist during the mission to expose Saren, the turrets come up from their concealed positions to assist Fist in fighting off the intruders. However, the guns ultimately fail to help Fist as they are destroyed by the squad, which then proceeds to deal with Fist.

Tactics[]
The Defensive Turrets have light shielding and health and can be taken out by a few short bursts from an assault rifle or a couple barrels from the shotgun. Once disposed of, move on to Fist.
