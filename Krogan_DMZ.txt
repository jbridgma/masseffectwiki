The Krogan DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a star cluster relatively close to the Local Cluster and Serpent Nebula, towards the galactic center. As the name would imply, it is home to the birthplace of the krogan race, Tuchanka, and nearby star systems occupied by the krogan prior to and during the Rachni Wars and Krogan Rebellions.
