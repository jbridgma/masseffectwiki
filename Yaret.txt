Yaret is a mechanic living in Hjara Station.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Background[]
Like a lot of her peers, Yaret came from Aya. She was a civil engineer back there, though when she went to Voeld she became Hjara's research equipment mechanic. 
She likes the job and deems every day exciting despite the hardscrabble living. She supposes Hjara needs her more than Aya.

Mass Effect: Andromeda[]
Yaret saw the Tempest's landing on Voeld and tells Pathfinder Ryder she's impressed with the starship when they meet. She stole a kett land vehicle and is performing maintenance on it when the Pathfinder talks to her. The kett destroyed the angara's land cruiser, so she deemed it fair to "repurpose" one of theirs.
If Ryder's impressed, she indicates she's aware the Pathfinder's doing a lot more than stealing from their enemy. If Ryder asks if the kett give them trouble, she indicates they're combat-trained and capable of holding their own during their occasional clashes. She's more concerned about the Kett Base's air superiority since it tends to shoot anything flying that isn't kett.
If Ryder asks about their usage of kett machinery, Yaret tells them the angara only do it when they stumble upon it or steal it. The angara are wary of leftover kett equipment since they're often booby-trapped, a technique Yaret thinks the kett learned from the angara.
Yaret has no interest working with Remnant since she can't activate their tech. She finds the monoliths fascinating though, and would like to tinker around inside given the opportunity. If Ryder inquires, she points them towards the north.
