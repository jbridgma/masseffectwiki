Description[]
Named for a legendary asari archer from Thessia's Iron Age, Teukria is an asteroid large enough to qualify as a dwarf planet or, as some term it, a "mesoplanet." Its gravity is sufficient to give it a spherical shape. Developed for nickel and iron mining, Teukria was abandoned before the Reapers reached the system. Its facilities are now dark and cold.
