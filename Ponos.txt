Description[]
Ponos is a typical hydrogen-helium gas giant. Its once-vital helium-3 refining machinery in orbit around the planet was destroyed in one of Aite's many wars, and Aite's extraplanetary trade suffered severely as a result. The dictators of Aite are not pleased with this situation, but they consider it a bad strategic move to be the first to start work on a refinery before eliminating any chance of other nations (or planets) seizing it.
