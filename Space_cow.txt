Space Cows are orange-and-white herbivores with orange irises, four legs, and two small arm-like forelimbs with two fingers each. 
Space Cows naturally graze in herds. There are wild herds on Chasca, Nodacrux and Ontarom,  as well as on Aite.
These creatures can be talked to, but they don't talk back.  Space Cows aren't startled by gunfire, vehicle ramming, or anything else. Killing them for whatever reason does not even elicit any reaction from their herdmates, but it may draw notice from the Galactic Humane Society should they learn of it as "animals are people too" in their view.
Space Cows are edible by humans. Gil Brodie mentions in particular that overcooked Space Cow tongue is incredibly tough.

Mass Effect[]
The Shifty Looking Cow on Ontarom steals credits while Commander Shepard isn't looking at it.

Mass Effect 2[]
On Aite, Shepard can use the Hammerhead to kill Space Cows. The vehicle's VI dryly analyzes that "defenseless herbivores are no match for guided missiles." Persistently targeting the creatures leads to more comments from the VI, until it states that targeting systems do not require local wildlife to calibrate.

Trivia[]
The Space Cows in Mass Effect have no audio for any environmental cues. In Mass Effect 2, they squeal bovine sounds on death.
Cut Content[]





The following information is drawn from cut content and is not to be considered canon in any way.

An unused Mass Effect soundbank contains the audio for the space cows, which differs from Mass Effect 2; they apparently sounded more like elephants somehow.[1]
The character file for Eden Prime contains references to the space cow, which is also labelled "hexa cow."[2] "Hexa-cows" are mentioned in a cut dialogue between Ashley and Kaidan which would have occurred during Prologue: Find the Beacon. Ashley remarks: "Local herd species. High milk yields. Meat's a bit tough, though", which sounds consistent with Gil Brodie's remark in Mass Effect: Andromeda.[3]
