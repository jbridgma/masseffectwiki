Turians are guards of the arms dealer Illo Nazario. When Jacob Taylor arrives on Tortuga to learn of Illo’s dealings with the batarians, he has to fight his way through them. They are recognizable by their grey color.

Tactics[]
Turians have moderate health and kinetic shielding. Like any other enemy in Mass Effect Galaxy, their shields will begin to regenerate 1.5 seconds after being disabled, but their health will not.
Turians will attack at medium and short ranges with their assault rifles. Their shots don’t do much damage and they lack any special attacks.
While Jacob’s powers fully affect Turians, their use is not necessary and should be prioritized for Turian Elites.
