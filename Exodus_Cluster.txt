The Exodus Cluster was one of the first extrasolar clusters reached by humans, and it was one of the first to be colonized by the Systems Alliance. The mass relay to Earth's cluster, however, actually goes to Arcturus Station rather than to the Charon Relay directly.

Trivia[]
The Exodus Cluster is probably named for the story of the Exodus of the Jewish people, who were led from Egypt to the promised land by Moses. Exodus is Greek for "departure". The systems and planets it contains are named for the ideal planes of various belief systems.
