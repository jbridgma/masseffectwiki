Doctor Euthalia is a cut character in Mass Effect who would have appeared during Global Plot 3. She was a valuable asari scientist who had suddenly gone missing in hanar space.
Dr. Euthalia is said to be one of the asari's most respected and foremost scientists, as well as "one of the brightest and most notable experts in all of Citadel Space." She was travelling through the Attican Traverse when she went missing on her way to a hanar colony, where she was going to be decorated for ridding the colony of a deadly virus. Despite all this, the hanar feign ignorance on the matter of her disappearance.[1]
Shepard soon finds out her ship was attacked by unknown forces, and a hanar official reveals she was probably kidnapped by the lystheni as part of their war against the hanar, intending to force Euthalia to develop a bioweapon targetting the hanar. Shepard is told to investigate a lystheni facility located on an asteroid to locate the doctor.[2]
Inside the facility, Shepard comes across Euthalia's assistant, Nuriam, who for a time pretends to be Dr. Euthalia herself until the real doctor shows up. Euthalia reveals she caused the viral outbreak throughout the facility which causes lystheni to become mutated and mindless, and somehow Nuriam is a carrier for it. Horrified, Nuriam runs off while Euthalia stays with Shepard's squad.[3]
Later on, Shepard has to choose between stopping a data upload that could be devastating for the hanar, or going after Nuriam to rescue her. If Shepard chooses the latter, Euthalia voices her protest but reluctantly follows. After finding Nuriam severely wounded from an attack of mutated lystheni, Euthalia refuses to heal her, to the squadmates' disbelief and anger. Whether she lives or dies, soon after Shepard's team leaves the facility with Euthalia and meet again with the hanar senator.[4] While the hanar representative voices his gratitude, Euthalia may also intervene and becomes suddenly critical of the hanar, possibly in reaction to Nuriam's fate. After that, the assignment is completed as the doctor has been successfully rescued.[5]
