Description[]
A highly accurate rifle, the Sandstorm was developed by exiles from the Nexus after their arrival in Heleus. The design of the semi-automatic weapon has been streamlined and appears to adapt certain non-Initiative technologies.

Features[]
The Sandstorm is the only weapon in the game besides sniper rifles to have a built-in scope. While this does provide a significant accuracy boost, the severe restrictions on peripheral vision it imposes on the shooter make it unsuited for close quarters combat.
The singleplayer Sandstorm Ranks I-IX uses Vanadium for development while Rank X uses Element Zero.
Compared to most weapons, the multiplayer Sandstorm saw numerous reductions to its stats due to its power. Its damage increased as of the very last update, though its clip size, max ammo, and rate of fire are all diminished. Its reload time is actually increased from 1.5 seconds to 1.6 seconds.

Strategies[]
For a semi-automatic assault rifle, it has a large clip and a lot of reserve ammo.
Because it is unsuited for the frantic nature of close-quarters battle, it is best treated as a designated marksman's rifle, dealing with threats from mid- to long-range.

A common augmentation to use with the Sandstorm is the Beam Emitter. The Beam Emitter essentially converts the weapon to fully automatic, while eliminating any recoil, and makes full use of the weapon's extreme damage per second, which is designed to be limited by its normally semi-automatic rate of fire. The downside of the Beam Emitter is the high ammunition consumption, which the weapon is not designed for.

Trivia[]
Although the Sandstorm is stated to be an Exile invention, it sees widespread use among the rabidly xenophobic Roekaar as their standard infantry armament. No explanation is ever given why the Roekaar have such a preference for something developed by some their worst enemies, nor where or how they acquired their extensive stockpiles of Sandstorm rifles.
Similarly, Vederia Damali wields a Sandstorm rifle aboard the Ark Leusinia in Cora Harper's loyalty mission. Since the Leusinia had no contact with anything in Heleus but the Kett prior to Ryder's intervention, and the kett are unlikely to have brought the weapon aboard, it is somewhat mysterious how Vederia acquired it.
