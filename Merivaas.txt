Merivaas is a merchant on Aya. He typically sells resources as well as an ample stock of augmentations on the Marketplace.
Merivaas observes Pathfinder Ryder has been permitted entry past the gates. If Ryder detects a hostile vibe, the merchant assures them their rescue of the Moshae grants them access to his wares. If Ryder promises to be respectful, Merivaas allows them the chance to prove it.
