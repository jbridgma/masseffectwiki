Turvess is the homeworld of the raloi.

Description[]
Shortly after Turvess' indigenous species, the raloi, launched their first space telescope in 2184 CE, they spotted the asari cruiser Azedes in their system. The asari initiated first contact, and the raloi were formally welcomed into the galactic community the following year by a Citadel-sponsored delegation that landed on the planet. To protect the raloi from possible contamination from diseases borne by other species, other ships were prohibited from landing.
