Description[]
When the Alliance's Offensive Handgun Project received funding to update one of its designs, its engineers chose to redesign the already impressive Phalanx pistol. Like its predecessor, the Eagle is a compact, fully automatic pistol that delivers unprecedented accuracy and punch with a rapid firing rate. The Eagle is named after the Desert Eagle, a classic handgun which gained a romantic reputation among gun collectors, thanks to its popularity in 20th- and 21st-century Earth action movies.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
The N7 Eagle is included in the N7 Collector's Edition Pack as a bonus item for players who order the Collector's or Digital Deluxe Edition of Mass Effect 3. An e-mail is received as part of the acquisition package.




N7 Weaponry


From: Lt. D. Eugene

Commander Shepard:

Your VI, EDI, put in a request to me for a handful of N7-grade weapons. Happy to oblige. I led the engineers who retrofitted the Normandy when it was turned over to the Alliance. EDI kept me company when we were overhauling the Normandy's interior. She's a beautiful ship, Commander. I'll miss working on her.

I left the guns in your weapons locker.

Best of luck,
Lieutenant D. Eugene

Alliance Engineering Corp.


In the Legendary Edition it is available from the Spectre Requisitions terminal in the Citadel Embassies for a base amount of 80,000 credits.

Multiplayer
Weapons are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The N7 Eagle is categorized as ultra-rare and requires no multiplayer expansion packs.

Player Notes[]
GeneralMultiplayer 
General
The Eagle is the only fully automatic heavy pistol, and it can be thought of as basically an SMG in pistol form. It is comparable with the M-12 Locust, firing slower but dealing more damage per shot; accuracy is comparable, though the Eagle has more muzzle climb while weighing even less.
Unlike an SMG, the Eagle can be equipped with the Pistol Heavy Barrel making it quite a bit more damaging in exchange for a weight increase. Pistol Ultralight Materials can almost entirely offset the extra weight.
The Eagle deals about the same damage per shot as the much heavier M-13 Raptor sniper rifle, and it has a higher capacity thermal clip. While not as accurate, the Eagle is still precise and controllable enough for long range shooting if the user aims down sights and/or fires from cover, and the Pistol Scope can be equipped for sniper rifle-level accuracy if desired.
The Eagle has a very good supply of extra thermal clips, useful to support constant firing.
Like all weapons that do best with continuous firing, this tends to expose the user to more return damage.
The Eagle is easily the best heavy pistol to use in tandem with the Marksman power. The rate of fire and accuracy increases can turn it into a weapon devastating at all ranges. Add in the Pistol Heavy Barrel, the Pistol Magazine Upgrade, and Armor-Piercing Ammo/Rounds and the Eagle can chew through even armored targets with ease. While it can't compete with the damage output of some weapons like the N7 Hurricane at close ranges, this is made up for by its very high level of accuracy and stability. Enemy heads or weak points can be consistently hit, making it more damaging than less precise weapons in skilled hands.
Multiplayer
The Eagle works well in the hands of a Turian Soldier or Quarian Marksman Soldier due to its effectiveness with the Marksman power.
The N7 Eagle I now has a default clip size of 24 rounds (43 with Pistol Magazine Upgrade mod), and 192 spare, allowing for more shooting and less reloading than with a Pistol Piercing Mod/High-Caliber Barrel (or Pistol Heavy Barrel) mod setup. It also makes the Eagle the highest capacity heavy pistol in the game.
The Eagle becomes devastating when used by N7 Destroyer Soldier. With the magazine bonuses from Devastator Mode, and the Pistol Magazine Upgrade mod, the Eagle can have over 50 rounds in a clip. Combining this with the Destroyer's rate of fire bonuses means the Eagle shoots nearly as fast as the M-76 Revenant while sporting comparable damage, but with the benefit of accuracy and minimal recoil.

Description[]
An update of the M-5 Phalanx, the compact Eagle was named after the Desert Eagle pistol that gained a romantic reputation among collectors due to its popularity in classic Earth action movies. A sympathetic agent inside the Systems Alliance provided the Initiative with the N7 military variant.

Post-launch, the Eagle's accuracy was improved. In multiplayer it also gained incremental increases in damage, clip size, max ammo and rate of fire, and its reload speed improved to 1.25 seconds compared to 1.5 seconds.
