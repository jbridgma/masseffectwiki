Turian Snipers are turian troops equipped with sniper rifles and specialized for long-range engagements. 
They are first encountered by the Randall Ezno during the mission to recover a turian target. They are also part of the turian's raid, presumably sent by the Turian Hierarchy, on the Barn space station, a Cerberus base.

Tactics[]
Turian snipers have low health, and possess a weak layer of shielding on top, which will regenerate over time. This fragility is offset by their high damage output.
Turian Snipers will often sit behind cover, popping out only to take a shot. Using Pull will bring them into the open.
Like other humanoid enemies in the game, they're vulnerable to headshots, which will inflict bonus damage to them.
Sniper rifles are very powerful, and since the game doesn't display your health, it is possible to suddenly get killed with a single shot.
Snipers' shots are always preceded by red targeting beams. When you see one appear, either dive into cover or use Slide to avoid it.
