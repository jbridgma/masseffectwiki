Fish are aquatic creatures that may be edible, decorative, or both. They're collectible items for Commander Shepard's personal cabin on the Normandy SR-2. There is a large aquarium on the left side of the cabin which can be filled with fish. There are various types of fish available and the stores that sell them will restock after every purchase.

Mass Effect 2[]
Care[]
Shepard's piscine companions must be fed after every mission or assignment to ensure that they remain alive. This can be extended to two assignments or missions back to back, provided there's no returning to the Normandy in between. Otherwise, the dead fish must be cleaned out and new ones must be purchased.
After each new squadmate is recruited, a new option to flirt with Kelly Chambers will be available. If this is done often enough and she has been invited to dinner (the earliest possible opportunity is just before the mission to Horizon), the option to have her feed the fish will become available. Kelly will offer fish care even if there aren't any fish in the tank currently.

Care[]
Fish can again be obtained for display in Shepard's cabin aquarium on the Normandy. They must still be fed after every mission or they will die.
After Shepard's surrender to the Alliance and the Normandy's subsequent impoundment following the mission to stop the Collectors, Kelly Chambers rescues any fish that were aboard if she had been asked to care for them and she survived the suicide mission. If Shepard meets her again at the makeshift refugee camp on the Citadel prior to undertaking a vital mission to the krogan homeworld, she will return the fish.

Only available if Kelly Chambers saves Shepard's fish from Mass Effect 2.

Aquarium VI[]

"With so many exotic species of fish available in today's galactic market, it takes an expert to maintain an ideal aquarium. This VI automatically dispenses food, adjusts the temperature, pH, and algae content of the water, and even talks to the fish when you're not around, leaving you free to enjoy your aquatic friends without fear of killing them."
Shepard can purchase an upgrade module for fish tank that will automatically feed and care for the fish. The Aquarium VI is available for purchase at the Elkoss Combine Arsenal Supplies terminal in the Presidium Commons of the Citadel for a base cost of 25,000 credits.

Trivia[]
While on the Citadel in Mass Effect 2, Shepard overhears a krogan named Kargesh wondering whether there are fish in the Presidium lakes. Similarly, while walking around on the Presidium in the first game, Wrex states that he is hungry, and asks if Shepard thinks there are any fish in the lake.
When purchasing the first fish at Citadel Souvenirs, a turian/asari couple are also browsing the store's selection. As their dialogue progresses, the asari advises her lover to purchase a fish, leading him to say that he doesn't see the point of buying something which will only live a few years. The asari then says that it's about embracing the time you spend with the fish, causing the turian to complain that he doesn't want to have "the lifespan talk".
Due to its unusual means of movement and tendency to swim "racetrack" circles, the Prejek Paddle Fish frequently clips right through the aquarium walls, swimming freely around in the air of Shepard's cabin or going through the ceiling and floor of the tank, before drifting back into the aquarium. This usually happens right after feeding.
In Lair of the Shadow Broker, Liara has a fish tank in her apartment. It contains all of the fish that Shepard can acquire, in addition to the Belan Jellyfish, which was made available for purchase in Mass Effect 3.
If you import a save from Mass Effect 2 with a live Prejek Paddlefish into Mass Effect 3 and you manage to keep it alive through the entire playthough, starting a new game by importing the same character's Mass Effect 3 save file will unlock a special bonus from the Intel Terminal in Liara's cabin on the Normandy.
On the Wii U version of Mass Effect 3, the Prejek Paddlefish is awarded after Priority: Mars on your second playthrough if Kelly Chambers and the crew were alive in your initial playthrough. All your fish from the previous playthrough are returned at this point as well.[1]
During Citadel Docks: Retake the Normandy, if Shepard owns a Space Hamster and finds it in the Normandy CIC, Shepard makes a comment about checking on their fish to make sure they weren't disposed of as well. Like the Space Hamster, all of Shepard's fish will be fine.
In Mass Effect 3: Citadel, if Miranda gets invited to Shepard's apartment, during a conversation regarding the damaged sushi restaurant, Miranda will comment about how "executing marine life" seems to be a hobby of Shepard's, possibly referring to how players may accidentally let their fish die in Mass Effect 2.
The fish tank in the Captain's Cabin office area on the Normandy may be a reference to Star Trek: The Next Generation, in which there is a fish tank in Captain Picard's ready room aboard the Enterprise-D.
