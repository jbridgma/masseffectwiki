Description[]
Located within the life zone of a dimming orange sun, Vatar would be habitable except for its carbon-dioxide atmosphere and an icy surface that kills most oxygen-producing bacteria. Nonetheless, mercenary companies and slavers have numerous strongholds on the planet, out of reach of any galactic authority.
TRAVEL ADVISORY: A statistically significant number of distress signals have originated within the 1-million-kilometer mark of Vatar. Civilian travel is not advised.
