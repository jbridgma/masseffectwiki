Description[]
Cold and dry, Neith has a thin nitrogen atmosphere and vast salt flats at its equator, which is warm enough for liquid water to pool during the summer period. The revealed salt is collected and sold to sodium-poor planets for agricultural purposes.
During the Anhur Rebellions, Neith was a staging ground for Eclipse ships, and was the site of their first defeat, when enemy Na'hesit surprised and routed them with a superior force. Some wreckage from the battle can still be found on the planet today.
