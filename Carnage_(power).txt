Player Notes[]
As with all projectile powers, Carnage does not launch an actual projectile when used by a squadmate. Instead, it instantly hits the target.
The projectile has a high force component that can stagger targets like Guardians and even heavier enemies like Atlases, exposing Guardians for about 3 seconds.
Carnage deals 50% bonus damage to armor, but only half damage to barriers and shields.[1]
Carnage's projectile tracks like Throw or Concussive Shot but travels and recharges more slowly, though it still travels fast enough that enemies may not be able to dodge it at close range.
You do not need to equip a Shotgun to use the ability as you did to use in Mass Effect—it is usable with any weapon.
Like Incinerate, Carnage can both prime and detonate Fire Explosions. An effective tactic for using this combo is to ignite one enemy at the center of a crowd with Incendiary Ammo, Inferno Grenade or Incinerate and then launching Carnage at them, turning them into a powerful bomb that will damage, ignite, and potentially kill surrounding enemies.
Carnage does relatively high damage for a power. If specialised for power damage, including passive power damage bonuses, Carnage can deal over 700 damage.
The Rank 5 Incapacitate evolution will knock down most unprotected lesser (red bar) enemies within the area of effect. Choosing the Rank 4 Radius evolution maximizes the utility of this effect.
Carnage detonates Fire, Tech and Cryo Power Combos, and, with Patch 1.04, sets up Fire Explosions. However, the fire combo priming set up lasts only a short time, so you have to be quick with a follow up power to make use of this. If timing is quick enough, this works even if Carnage was already used to detonate a Tech Burst or Cryo Explosion.
After successfully hitting a target, Carnage continues to deal mild fire damage over time. This is not mentioned in the power description.
Carnage is not considered a tech power and won't benefit from modifiers to tech power damage, such as the Tech Vulnerability evolution of Sabotage or the Power Synergy evolution of Defense Matrix.
The bodies of most infantry enemies killed by a direct hit from Carnage explode.
