Deleia Sanassi is an asari living and working on the Citadel. She is the shopkeeper at Citadel Souvenirs on level 27 of Zakera Ward. 







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




Because all of the purchasing is now handled via electronic catalogue, Deleia's job is to answer questions and handle item refunds. She handles confrontational customers with poise unless flustered by unexpected remarks.
Commander Shepard can obtain a discount from her by providing a celebrity endorsement of the shop. Alternatively, accusing Deleia of discriminating against the poor when Shepard comments on the high prices of the "cheap touristy crap" and Deleia suggests finding another shop will also secure a discount. If the Commander has had their Spectre status restored, Deleia grants Shepard a Citadel Council Employee discount upon being informed.
