Player Notes[]
The boosts to shield strength from this power also apply to the Hex Shield power.
Increasing melee damage does *not* affect the amount of shields drained by Heavy Melee.
The Geth Juggernaut's melee damage remains rather poor regardless of evolutions.
Evolving the last rank for melee damage does not make the Geth Juggernaut's melee a powerful damage dealer; but with the 15% overall damage penalty of the alternative there certainly is a difference.
A Geth Juggernaut still gains the benefit of the Squad Command evolution from another Geth Juggernaut.  Two Juggernauts with the Squad Command evolution can boost each other.
