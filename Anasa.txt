Anasa is a system east of the Heleus Cluster's Black Hole. It is one FTL jump away from Govorkam, Zaubray, and Eriksson.
Despite its proximity to major settled systems Anasa is hostile to colonization attempts. It is mainly used as a surveillance post, or a place to lie low or make a quick buck.
Radio emissions from the black hole are particularly strong in Anasa. Suvi poetically calls it the "song of the dark side of creation."
