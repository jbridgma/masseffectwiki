Description[]
Nepheron is a barren, volcanic terrestrial world with an atmosphere of carbon dioxide and krypton. Its surface is mainly composed of sodium with deposits of magnesium. 
Aside from displays of geologic beauty (including many spectacular volcanoes), this barren world is of little interest. Entries relating to Nepheron in the astronomical database are sparse.

Properties[]
Many of the points of interest and mineral deposits within the operational area are situated on crevices at high altitudes. A lot of climbing up and tumbling down steep mountains on the Mako is to be expected even if considering the shortest distance required to reach all of them.
The operational area also features a very light barely-visible hail of particulate matter.
