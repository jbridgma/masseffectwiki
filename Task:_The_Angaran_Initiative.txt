Aya Diplomatic Efforts
To: Ryder
From: Director Jarun Tann

When we left our old home, we never planned on having to negotiate with an alien civilization for a new one. It's vital we placate the angara and keep them on our side. They've opened an embassy on Aya and our diplomatic team is already settling in. I'm counting on you to ensure our success.

You've established ties with the Resistance leader, the Moshae, and Aya's governor. Do all you can to learn everything about them and their supporters. The better we understand Aya's political structure, the more successful we'll be gaining their help colonizing Heleus.


Director Tann



Acknowledge the email to start the mission.

Visit The Andromeda Initiative Embassy On Aya[]
Head to the Andromeda Initiative Embassy on Aya. When Ryder enters, Ambassador Rialla assures Tann that everything is going well. To Ryder, she says that she has never lied to a director before. She asks Ryder for help with two issues - each is a new mission that starts automatically when the conversation is over: The Vesaal and Task: The Nexus Exchange. (The latter requires Ryder to ask her about "Other problems.")
