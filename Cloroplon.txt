Description[]
Cloroplon is a relatively small hydrogen-helium gas giant, with a haze of methane in the upper atmosphere.

Trivia[]
Cloroplon is too small to be a "hydrogen-helium gas giant" (William Hubbard, The New Solar System 4th ed, 1999; p. 194). It is more likely a dense "ice giant" like Neptune or Gliese 436 b.
