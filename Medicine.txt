This article is about the talent in the first Mass Effect game and its unlockable Neural Shock ability. For the Neural Shock power in Mass Effect 2, see Neural Shock. For the Neural Shock power evolution in Mass Effect 3, see Overload. For pharmaceuticals in general, see Drugs.

Medicine is an unlockable tech talent available to Engineers and Sentinels. Medicine lowers the cooldown time on First Aid, and also enables the Neural Shock ability.

Neural Shock[]


In Mass Effect Neural Shock is an ability unlocked by the progression of the Medicine talent. It induces paralysis and does toxic damage, but only works on organic foes, including humanoids, Husks, Thorian Creepers, rachni and varren. Unlike many other talents in Mass Effect, Neural Shock has the same 45 second recharge time at all levels.
The best advantage Neural Shock gives you is the ability to slow an organic enemy or drop them in their tracks. This makes it a useful talent when facing especially dangerous enemies such as krogan. Once injured they like to charge you and close rapidly for a melee attack, which can be lethal on higher difficulty settings. Use Neural Shock when they are still at a distance to slow them down, giving you time to kill them with gunfire. It also helps to stop their health from regenerating mid-battle.
It's important to aim precisely with the crosshair directly over the target as Neural Shock has no area of effect like many biotic talents and it launches no tech proximity mine like most tech talents do. A few enemies also possess Neural Shock which can disable you or your squadmates much like enemy biotics can, but without even needing to land a projectile. These enemies are rarely encountered but can be very dangerous.
