“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Mass Effect: Andromeda[]
Considered young for her position, Avela believes that there are numerous angaran relics scattered across the Heleus Cluster that predate the Scourge and survived the subsequent fall of angaran civilization. Pathfinder Ryder can look for these artifacts and bring them to her. Additionally, a scientist on Havarl sent her the navpoint for a crash site, and she also wants the Pathfinder to check it out.

Romance[]
Avela is a potential romantic interest for a male Ryder. Just prior to finding Meridian, Ryder can choose to do something about their relationship.
