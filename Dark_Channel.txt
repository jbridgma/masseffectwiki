Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Dark Channel deals almost 4x more damage in multiplayer than in single-player.
Targets afflicted with Dark Channel can cause Biotic Explosions when detonated with powers such as Warp or Biotic Charge.
Unlike Reave, Dark Channel's damage-over-time effect cannot stack on a single target with repeat casts, as only one Dark Channel effect can be active at a time per user.
Dark Channel does not launch a projectile when used by the player; it is a hitscan power that impacts instantly; this is useful as enemies can't dodge it.
Banshees' and Praetorians' power immunity shields cannot block Dark Channel transferred from dead enemies.
Guardian and CAT6 Heavy shields can block Dark Channel regardless of the source, though the protection is directional.
Dark Channel will keep jumping to as many targets as closely available until the duration time expires (not just a second target as the description implies). If there are no nearby targets, the field dies (even if there is duration time left).
By default, Dark Channel deals 150% the damage to armor, double the damage to barriers and only half the damage to shields.
The Pierce evolution on rank 6 applies a multiplicative bonus on armor and barrier modifiers.
After Dark Channel jumps to another target, its special damage modifiers are lost and it deals the same amount of damage to all defenses including shields (the damage it would normally deal to red bar health on its initial cast).
Strategies
Since it transfers to another enemy when the affected target dies, Dark Channel can be used to set up several biotic combos in rapid succession. Use Dark Channel on weak infantry, then use a detonator power like Seeker Swarm or Throw for optimal results.
Dark Channel is also very effective against isolated groups of Swarmers as it will continue killing them instantaneously and jumping to the next one until they are all killed.
Like all damage-over-time effects, Dark Channel is useful for revealing invisible enemies and preventing enemy shields or barriers from recharging.
Dark Channel's long duration is useful for enabling the bonus weapon damage to "lifted" targets (i.e. primed for a Biotic Explosion) afforded by Warp Ammo/Warp Rounds.
