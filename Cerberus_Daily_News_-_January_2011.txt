January 2011 - Week One[]


01/01/2011 - Human New Year Celebrated on the Citadel

“Last night's observance of the human New Year on the Citadel is already being called "the shower of gold," and is getting endless coverage on morning news shows. After the New Year's Eve time ball was stolen, event organizers created an emergency team to stage the climactic moment. After assembling over 350 biotic attendants, organizers dumped four hundred kilos of glitter and mylar strips at the base of the spire. During the final countdown, the biotics lifted the mass into the sky, held it there with singularities, then, as strobe lights fired in time with the new year, pushed and pulled the sparkles into a tornado that rained down on partygoers. "I got it all over my scalp and some in my mouth," said one asari, "but I also proposed to my bondmate at midnight, so I'd say the night was a big success."”

01/02/2011 - From BioWare's Cerberus Daily News Team

“OUT-OF-GAME NOTICE: The Cerberus Daily News will begin a hiatus on January 24th, finishing its run of one full year. Daily postings will cease except for three weeks in 2011: a week of posts will precede a downloadable content release, and two more weeks will lead up to the release of Mass Effect 3. The CDN team thanks fans for their attention, comments, and feedback (both in and out of character!). We are sorry to go, but we had fun -- we hope you did, too!”


January 2011 - Week Two[]


01/03/2011 - Demonstrations Over Water Rights on Olor Turn Violent

“Riots broke out today on the colony world of Olor as part of a fierce struggle over water rights. Demonstrations at the corporate headquarters of the municipal water company AquaStructure turned violent when corporate police attempted to break up protestors. Firebombs and gunfire ended with thirteen dead and forty wounded. This is one of many recent demonstrations that have called attention to the dichotomy between wealthy salarians and poor humans on the planet. The breaking point came when AquaStructure decided against building pipes in the human district of Xi Hu, effectively denying the residents any hope of running water. "I just thought that's how the colony was going to be," said Chunkai Zhi, one of the human residents. "Then I found out that the salarian districts were getting all the water they wanted. That's not right." AquaStructure representatives had no comment on today's violence.”




01/04/2011 - Mold Found on Strains of Sathur-Grown Ossilbir Vine

“An unexpected issue has developed after a new vine was introduced on the colony world of Sathur: mold. "The Alliance Bureau of Food and Drug Safety confirmed that the mold, which forms as a thin, non-poisonous layer of powder on some strains of ossilbir, easily washes off without a trace," Governor Vien Suchart assured the press. "All ossilbir shipped off-planet is thoroughly washed and inspected before packaging." While the mold has no toxic properties for most levo-amino-based sapient species, several reports of people experiencing hallucinogenic episodes after ingesting small quantities of the mold -- referred to as "Creeper" in some black markets -- have surfaced. While properly cleaned vegetation can still be legally shipped from Sathur, more than 60 Citadel worlds are recalling products made with ossilbir grown on the colony.”

01/05/2011 - Humans and Turians Conduct Military Exercises on Kruljaven

“Humans and turians are gathering on the planet Kruljaven today to participate in joint training and survival exercises between their two militaries. "The Alliance is pleased to coordinate this effort with the Turian Hierarchy," said Admiral Pat Forsythe. "Our marines will compete against their turian counterparts in a series of mock battles in harsh environments that will test preparedness in the face of extreme conditions." Outside observers are calling it a diplomatic move aimed at increasing cooperation between the two races as Earth's military becomes increasingly involved in Citadel defense plans. Spokespeople for both parties denied that the exercises have anything to do with current tensions on Khar'shan. "Similarities between the planets are purely coincidental, and official commentary on the Khar'shan situation comes directly from the office of the Citadel Council," said Forsythe.”




01/06/2011 - Illium Hosts Controversial Krogan Art Showcase

“The mixed media showcase of krogan creative works, "One in a Thousand," opened last night at Illium's prestigious Municipal Institute of Art. As krogan history is often viewed by others as violent and tragic, the art display challenges viewers to rethink their established views on krogan culture. Dr. Alissa Banser, the institute's program coordinator, explains: "We wanted to explore different aspects of the krogan people, from the dark to the sublime. We hope to inspire debate on the very nature of how we define 'art'." Some early reviews have hailed Dr. Banser as courageous; others call the showcase "exploitative" and "in poor taste," noting that few, if any, of the show's pieces were created by krogan artists. The showcase is on display until (Earth standard date) February 21.”




01/07/2011 - Voya's Parthinade Stadium Books Exclusive Performances

“The moon of Voya is shaping up to be the entertainment destination this year: to date, twelve major acts have been signed to play Voya's 600,000-seater stadium known as "The Parthinade". Tickets are already going fast for performers that include Domino Masque, Chatbak, M.D.G.S., and Lili T'Nigus. Interestingly, concert organizers are only releasing footage of the shows a year after a given performance. "These are one-of-a-kind concerts," says the Parthinade's booking manager Ivica Folnovic. "As such, our electronic security measures are geared toward blacking out outside recording devices. Our mission at the Parthinade is to host events that have to be seen live to be believed."”




01/08/2011 - Council Space Observes Space Safety and Awareness Week

“How prepared are you for a hull breach? Is your starship's registration up to date? Have all of your spacesuits been pressure-tested within the last six months? During Space Safety and Awareness Week, everyone inside Council space is being encouraged to make sure their safety knowledge is up to galactic standards. "It could save your life," says SSAW organizer Kyo Tanaka. "You don't want people terrified every time they start their engines, but they need to respond quickly and efficiently in the event of an accident. Most companies that train pilots offer refresher courses on navigation, maintenance, alien flight protocols, and emergency responses. Why not take advantage?"”




01/09/2011 - "A Fine Line: The Journal of Darkness and Hope" Hits Stores This Week

“"A Fine Line: The Journal of Darkness and Hope" hits stores this week, and the book is making waves with critics and audiences alike. Co-authored by asari prisoners of war, survivors Jiana Kintani and Bellah Ans tell the story of torture at krogan hands during their 140-year ordeal in the notorious POW camps of Planet Densaak. Communication was accomplished via a complex series of rapping that was barely audible through the wall separating the cells. The two were liberated at the hands of asari commandos and saw each other's faces for the first time aboard the military gunship that carried them off-planet. Kintani lost a long battle with the asari disease ahok fasciitis late last year, but lived to see her story in print, reading an advance copy on her deathbed.”


January 2011 - Week Three[]


01/10/2011 - Scientists on Mars Assess New Chamber in Prothean Ruins

“Controversy brews tonight as scientists on Mars assess the contents of a newly opened chamber in the Prothean ruins. The opening has been a dream of exoarchaeologists for decades, delayed by the many steps necessary to replicate Prothean code keys and crack the cryptography for entry. Critics say the Milky Way Foundation, which provided supercomputers for the cryptanalysis, could hoard any Prothean discoveries. Dr. Unira T'Lam, liaison from the Citadel Committee on Paleotechnology, says she's been kept in the dark. "Foundation personnel have orchestrated a security system that keeps out everyone except a select cabal," she accuses. "Anything could be taken from inside and we'd never know." Dr. Ilsa Warren, who heads the analysis unit, dismisses the allegation. "We've made it clear all technology stays in situ throughout the cataloging and analysis process, which could take years," she says. "Dr. T'Lam's fears would be more appropriate closer to the end of the decade."”




01/11/2011 - "Creeper" Drug Fetches Record Prices on Black Market

“"Creeper," a powerful new hallucinogenic drug, is fetching record prices at 9,000 credits per gram on the black market. Several fringe spiritual groups are claiming it grants especially potent visions, while recreational drug-users say it offers hours of colorful daydreams with virtually no side-effects. But not everyone is so sanguine about its use: "There are no long-term medical studies on the effects of creeper on someone's body," warns Doctor Darla Rory, a specialist on addictive substances. "And as always, people prone to addiction are at risk. Creeper's sense of escapism hooks people on a psychological level, not a chemical one. It's extremely insidious in that regard."”

01/12/2011 - Undocumented Human Colony Found in Alpha Centauri System

“Alliance headquarters on Arcturus Station is buzzing about an unusual incident tonight. Information is still sketchy, but it appears asari explorers have alerted Alliance leadership to a previously unknown colony of humans in the Alpha Centauri system. The asari were monitoring a primitive alien species on a planet in the region when a human party approached and ambushed them, taking at least one asari scientist prisoner. Rather than intervene and potentially inflame the situation, the asari contacted Alliance leadership to maintain peace. But as one Alliance source confided, that's easier said than done. The source explained: "The thing is, we can't find any record of these people. None. So what are they doing out there?" Further details will follow as the situation develops.”

01/13/2011 - Alliance Links Lost Colony with Manswell Expedition of 2070

“Surprising details have emerged about recently-discovered human colonists in the Alpha Centauri system who captured an asari scientist. Alliance ships performed a reconnaissance overflight of the planet in question and gathered details about a settlement there. After cross-referencing with Alliance databases, a clearer picture has emerged. An Alliance source explained: "These people are literally a lost colony in every sense of the word. We're 95% certain they originated from the Manswell Expedition of 2070." A background check reveals Victor Manswell was a billionaire who funded his own private spaceflight in the year 2075 after growing frustrated with the pace of official exploration. Pre-dating the use of mass effect relays, some 300 people joined the expedition and were placed in cryogenic freeze for the journey. After a successful launch the colonists were never heard from again... until today, if Alliance suspicions prove true.”

01/14/2011 - Alliance to Attempt Contact with Alpha Centauri Colony

“An effort is underway today in the Alpha Centauri system as Alliance specialists work to establish contact with a lost colony of early human explorers who took an asari scientist prisoner. Mission Commander Jon Hayes said: "As near as we can tell, these people slipped through the cracks. They were considered missing when communication was lost with their ship after they left in 2075 and fell off the radar, so to speak. It's entirely possible they have no idea what's happened in the galaxy for the last 110 years. We're treating it as a first contact situation." Accompanying the military will be experts from a variety of fields, including sociologists, anthropologists, linguists, psychologists, geneticists, and a host of supporting medical personnel. One anthropologist commented "It reminds me of those 19th century explorers who discovered tribes deep in the Amazon rainforest. The natives had no idea the wider world existed."”

01/15/2011 - Alpha Centauri Colony Mission Bears Mixed Results

“The mission to establish contact with a lost human colony from the Manswell Expedition bore mixed results this week. According to Commander Jon Hayes, Alliance ships landed far from the human settlement so as not to exacerbate an already uncertain situation. "We didn't want a whole armada of ships descending from the sky to spook these people." Nevertheless, the colonists feared an attack when Alliance personnel approached on foot. "They put up a spirited defense. A few of our people were wounded, and unfortunately they suffered a few casualties as well." Once the situation was under control, a dialogue with the colonists was opened. "It took some convincing that we were humans from Earth. They suspected an alien plot." Eventually, an Alliance representative was allowed into their camp to make contact with their leader and check on the condition of their asari prisoner. Details are pending.”

01/16/2011 - Asari Prisoner Released as Lost Colonists Cooperate with Alliance

“More news today out of the Alpha Centauri system, where an Alliance mission has made contact with a lost colony of human explorers from the Manswell Expedition of 2070. "To say these people are in a state of shock would be an understatement," said Commander Jon Hayes. "Nearly 120 years of history has passed them by. When they left Earth, nobody knew aliens even existed." The colonists' asari prisoner has been released and is in good condition. "They were understandably spooked by the asari. Who wouldn't be, seeing a biotic alien for the first time? In fact, I want to personally thank the asari for her restraint in this matter. She could have fought her way out, but once she understood the situation these people were in, she was patient and let the Alliance resolve the situation." Sociologists are now working with the colonists to decide the best course of action for the future.”

01/17/2011 - Manswell Expedition Colonists Decide Next Step

“Some closure today in the case of the lost colonists of the Manswell Expedition: after educating the colonists on the state of galactic affairs, Alliance personnel asked the group where they wished to live. Nearly half of them voted to stay on the planet, with one of them saying "Everything has changed so much that I don't see how I could ever go back. Mass relays? The Citadel? Robot wars? I wouldn't know what to make of any of that. I feel like a caveman seeing New York for the first time." Others were eager to rejoin galactic life. "I just discovered one of my descendents is still alive," another colonist explained. "How weird will that be, going back to see him?" An Alliance sociologist said they will help the colonists assimilate into modern life if they choose to return to Earth. "Follow-up interviews and seeing how they adjust should be fascinating," she said.”

01/18/2011 - Sathur's Governor Announces Immigration Freeze

“Sathur, home to fields of vines that produce the hallucinogenic drug commonly called "creeper", has frozen all immigration applications "until we can sort out genuine colonists from cut-and-run opportunists", declared Governor Vien Suchart. "A year ago, we were a colony of 4,000. Now we're receiving that many petitions for citizenship in an hour. Even if we wanted to accommodate every immigration request, we simply don't have the infrastructure." Governor Suchart says he'll be regulating ossilbir production facilities more closely, after several crates of creeper were discovered in the homes of factory workers last week.”

01/19/2011 - Authorities Baffled by Eezo Processing Plant Explosion

“Authorities remain baffled by the cause of an explosion at an element-zero processing plant that killed six last week on Planet Urksone. "You always risk a blast when you run test charges," says safety inspector Ziph Betress. "If your eezo is impure or you run the wrong voltage through it, bam. The plant's equipment seemed to be functioning fine, but we're still examining security footage." The plant's owner, Liyasha Losine, remains skeptical that the incident was accidental. "I'm not pleased Inspector Betress isn't pursuing the possibility of sabotage or other outside causes. We keep our safety systems in perfect working order. Element zero doesn't just become unstable on its own."”




01/20/2011 - Human Colony of Drasta Enacts Barter System

“The human colony of Drasta is hoping to attract potential settlers with its fresh air, clean rivers and hospitable climate... but don't bring your credits. "Internally, we're sticking to a barter system for our first ten years," say leader of the colony Loran Evanko. "Whether it's work, goods, or advice, we want the colony to be self-sufficient before we start using credits. It'll make us less of a target for raiders, motivate us to know the land, and help screen out romantics." Even visitors to Drasta will be asked to bring in useful goods or skills of their own while staying at the colony. "We're not tyrants," Evanko assures us. "Colony members can keep their accounts. We just ask them to make any fiscal transactions off-planet."”




01/21/2011 - Audiences Flock to See "Patriots" and "Dr. Kepral" This Week

“The weekend's box office is in, and awards season is in full swing. "Patriots", the true story of a human serving with the salarian navy stationed at Jaeto, netted a comfy 2.3 billion credits, while tearjerker biopic "Dr. Kepral" came in a close second at 2.24 billion. "May to December" examines an asari girl on a quest to learn the life story of her vorcha father, pulling a respectable 1.88 billion; and the ambitious remake of "All Souls' Rising" brings forth Earth's Haitian revolution in all its flawed glory, holding firm at 1.75 billion in its third week. On the lighter side, the slapstick "We the Sheeple" skewered just about every visible galactic politician for a modest 1.28 billion. Described by the producers as "all the laughs you expect from Orwell's 'Animal Farm' before you actually read it," the comedy is down 600 million from its opening weekend.”

01/22/2011 - Batarian and Alliance Forces in Standoff in Skyllian Verge

“The galaxy is on high alert as starships belonging to the Earth Systems Alliance and Batarian Hegemony refuse to back down from a confrontation in the Skyllian Verge. The encounter began when a frigate from the batarian colony of Aratoht discovered an Alliance cruiser, the SSV Budapest, on patrol in the Bahak system. The Alliance claims the Budapest was chasing a pirate fleet that has been harassing human colonies in the Skyllian Verge, and that it was fully within its rights to travel through Bahak's space. The Batarian Hegemony has demanded the Alliance's immediate withdrawal from their colony's system. Three batarian cruisers stationed on Aratoht are now on their way to join the confrontation.”

01/23/2011 - SSV Budapest Retreats from Batarian Space

“The Alliance cruiser that sparked a standoff between the Earth Systems Alliance and Batarian Hegemony has retreated from the Bahak system. Hegemony officials claim to have found no trace of the pirate fleet the Alliance was allegedly pursuing when the SSV Budapest flew into the system. The Alliance maintains it was chasing pirates raiding human merchant vessels when it crossed into batarian space, but refuses to release any of its ships' logs. Despite this, Citadel observers say the Alliance's withdrawal has done enough to ease tensions. "The Hegemony knows the Alliance is attempting to save face," said one anonymous Citadel diplomat. "At this juncture, the humans' retreat from Aratoht [in the Bahak system] has gone from a diplomatic crisis to an embarrassment they want swept under the rug."”

01/24/2011 - Paper Suggests Mass Relays Predate Protheans

“Historians and astronomers alike are abuzz tonight over a new paper published by Dr. Amanda Kenson of the University of Arcturus. Her team claims that by testing the dust trapped in the gravity wells around a mass relay, and comparing its composition to that of dust clouds in the same system, scientists can create a timeline of when the relay passed through the dust. Her conclusion? "Only a small fraction of the mass effect relays date back 50,000 years," she writes, "The majority are far older, indicating they were created by a species predating even the Protheans." Dr. Aurana T'Meles of the University of Serrice met the information with skepticism: "While Dr. Kenson's methods appear sound, the asari tried a similar procedure centuries ago and discounted it. What civilization could have spanned the galaxy for not thousands, but millions of years? If this were the case, we should have found mountains of evidence of their passing. Where is this species now?"”
