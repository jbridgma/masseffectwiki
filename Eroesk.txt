Eroesk is a destroyed daar southeast of Techiix. It lies close to the Kett Base, which is due southwest.
The Angaran Resistance managed to push out the kett from Eroesk. In response, the kett wiped out the daar. In the scramble to escape to safety the survivors left everything behind, among those a map of ancient Voeld, which is considered a priceless angaran artifact.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




A pair of turian smugglers from Kadara Port manage to recover the map, but are pinned down by constant kett reinforcements sent there to finish the job of destroying the daar. Should Pathfinder Ryder intervene, the map is successfully transported out.

Layout[]
The former daar is nestled on a snowy hill, with three exits in a Y configuration. The main area is exposed to the elements, although some infrastructure like doors, computer terminals, and solar heaters are still working.
There are 2 iridium nodes, 7 lootable containers, and 2 ammo supply caches around Eroesk. On the upper levels there's a small safe zone with patchy hazard spots featuring a working computer terminal.

OUTGOING MESSAGE: Taoshay
Translated from Shelesh:

Amalja,

No matter what happens, I love you. I don't regret a single moment—even this one. I'll tell the sun and stars about you.


Be happy, taoshay. Don't forget me.







Answer me!
Translated from Shelesh:

Meshaal, answer your comm. I heard there was an attack and I need to know you're okay. Please, just send a message.

Let me hear your voice. Don't do this to me.


-Ista







Sorry
Translated from Shelesh:

Papa,


Ennas and Visha say you aren't coming home. Is it because I broke your star chart? I'm really sorry. I won't do anything like that again. I'll save up all my earnings to buy you a new one. I'll be really good, I promise. Just come home.
