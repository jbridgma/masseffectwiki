Decoris is a small system with fairly abundant resources in its two terrestrial worlds. Mining is the only noteworthy industry here, although the worlds are basically frontier and far from developed, with the main drawbacks being wear and tear caused by extreme weather and the usual pirates stalking legitimate businesses.

Compared to other systems in Sigurd's Cradle, Decoris is relatively free of Reaper incursions. However, Cerberus has financial interests on Sanctum as well as a base of operations.
