Description[]
Jak Ser features heavily in ancient volus mythology and folklore, since its bright white surface made it easy to chart in the night sky without the aid of a telescope. Once the volus developed advanced astronomical equipment, their scientists discovered that Jak Ser's luminosity was caused by a thick carbon monoxide cloud cover that had hidden the real face of the planet for millennia.
