Description[]
An airless rock of mixed light ores, Raisaris is only of note for the Teryinu impact crater. A relatively recent asteroid strike (within the last million years), the core of the object was partly composed of element zero. It struck at a low enough velocity that the eezo remained near the surface. Over the years, many pirates and "wildcat" miners have attempted to extract the ore.
It is believed that the Teryinu debris originated in the pulsar system AAP34211+19. The supernova that formed the pulsar also created the red emission nebula that human spacers have unofficially named the Sakura Nebula.
