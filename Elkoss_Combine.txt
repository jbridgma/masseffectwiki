Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3[]
In Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, Elkoss Combine manufactures two small arms weapons:

M-4 Shuriken Machine Pistol
A common but effective submachine gun. Fires three-round bursts, and can be pulsed for a higher rate of fire at the expense of accuracy. Very effective against shields and biotic barriers. As kinetic barriers have grown in popularity, so has the popularity of submachine guns. Manufactured by the Elkoss Combine, the Shuriken machine pistol has a reputation for being deadly and easy to use, but is weak against armor.
M-8 Avenger Assault Rifle
A common, versatile, military-grade assault rifle. Accurate when fired in burst shots, and deadly when fired on full auto. The Avenger is effective at penetrating shields, armor and biotic barriers. The modular design and inexpensive components of the Avenger make it a favorite of military groups and mercenaries alike. The Avenger has a reputation for being tough, reliable, easy to use, and easy to upgrade. Manufactured by the Elkoss Combine.
Armor[]
Mass Effect[]
The use of reverse-engineered technology in Elkoss Combine armors causes a sizeable decrease in shields as well as biotic/tech protection, though regular damage protection is on par with competing products.[2]

The Cipher line of omni-tools also suffers from using reverse-engineered technology, resulting in a reduced cooldown time bonus and a nullified medical recharge bonus.[3]

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 45: Elkoss Combine's Field Efficiency gives -4% in Heat Absorption and -30% in Accuracy. Though a decrease can be observed in comparison to baseline stats, the percentages don't seem to match.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 45: Elkoss Combine's Reverse Technology gives -30% in both Shields and Hardening. When compared to baseline stats, the former appears correct, but the calculations for the latter don't match up, though a significant decrease is visible.
