The Blood Pack Boom-Squad are vorcha trained for an anti-personnel role in the Blood Pack organization. These individuals are commanded by a squad commander who is answerable to a krogan overseer.







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




In 2185, Commander Shepard's team fights boom squads around and in Gozu District's main ventilation control room. There is even a brief conversation with a boom squad leader where he reveals the origin of a plague infecting the district, and vorcha plans for the district.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
The standard armament of a Boom-Squad member is a missile launcher which they fire once, or twice in rapid succession, before ducking back behind cover.

Defensive
Like most vorcha, they wear light armor and depend on their natural regenerative abilities during a fight. They also tend to find cover quickly. They'll pop up for a few seconds at a time to shoot missiles.

Tactics[]
Save for the boom squad leader's team members, who fight at the same elevation as Commander Shepard's team, most other boom squads fight at a higher elevation. These squads will fire three or four rounds, reload behind cover, and then reappear to fire again. It is at these moments, when they reappear, that they are most vulnerable to attack. A sniper rifle is a good weapon for killing these enemies. Abilities which can arc around cover, such as Pull or Incinerate, work as well.
All vorcha enemies are generally unpredictable and react differently and in unexpected, often tactically unsound, ways.
They utilize cover well and sometimes close in on you no matter what their armament (even with rocket launchers), while a shotgun-armed vorcha may keep its distance.
They may forgo cover to strafe and fire in a manner similar to salarian Eclipse Troopers, or simply stand in the open and fire.
The Boom-Squad's rockets damage everyone. As such the Boom-Squad can be injured by their own rockets through numerous ways: firing from awkward cover positions, danger-close proximity to target, etc. However, their fast regeneration ensures they'll get back on their feet unless they're further shot dead quickly.
If there is a fellow enemy NPC directly in their line of sight to you the Boom-Squad will hesitate to fire. A high-risk scenario would be to goad the Boom-Squad to fire at you, anticipating that a nearby enemy NPC will take the hit instead.
While Boom-Squads are meant to fight at long range sometimes they refuse to fire at all, given enough distance, even if there is a direct line of sight to you or your squad.
If you can strip these enemies of their armor using a heavy pistol, they make good allies when using Dominate on them. They often take each other out when multiple enemies are standing on a higher elevation.
Incendiary Ammo, Incinerate, Inferno Grenade, Warp, Neural Shock, and Reave are very useful to permanently stop their health (red bar) regeneration on all difficulties and is fairly important on Hardcore and Insanity, where their regeneration is very swift. Their health regeneration is also paused temporarily while fully frozen. The Arc Projector can likewise end their ability to heal.
Killing a vorcha quickly or even instantly with a few headshots from an accurate weapon is an effective tactic as it denies them a chance to regenerate much, if any, health.
Boom-Squads cannot regenerate their armor bars like Blood Pack Troopers can.
