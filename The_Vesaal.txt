Speak to Sorvis Lenn[]
Sorvis is not known for being good at communicating. Go to the navpoint  and talk with him, and listen to his grave accusations. He claims that an angara blamed him for the death of a friend. When the angara left, Sorvis tagged him with a dye that a scanner can pick up.

Scan Resistance members[]
Now you need find that angara. Follow the navpoint to the Resistance Headquarters and go downstairs. He is standing near the Quartermaster Istaal. Use the scanner to make sure it's him - Jarryn Sjek.

Speak to Jarryn Sjek[]
Speaking with Sjek reveals that allowing Initiative people to move to Aya has upset the balance with an old system called the Vesaal. When one angara moves to Aya, another has to leave. There isn't enough room for all. To help make space for the Initiative people, a friend of Sjek sold his place and moved to Voeld, where he was killed fighting the kett. Sjek is upset about this, and that's why he was angry with Sorvis. Ryder understands the situation, and pledges to talk with the Initiative ambassador about this.

Return to Ambassador Rialla[]
In the conversation with Rialla, she says she didn't know about the Vesaal and wants to solve this. You're given some options on how to solve this.
