Unnamed human male
Unnamed human female

Human female: What do you think about the security? All the weapon detectors, the guards...
Human male: Yeah. Did you see the turrets on the way in?
Human female: The what?
Human male: Turrets. Outside. Big anti-ship weapons. Looks like they could fight off an orbital assault. A small one.
Human female: Yeah, but all the monitoring, cameras, and guards. It feels oppressive.
Human male: Really? With all the problems out here - pirates and whatnot? This might be one of the safest planets in the Traverse.

Human male: What have you heard about Peak 15?
Human female: That it's one of the lab complexes. And it's out of contact, or something.
Human male: Seems strange. The whole mountain going dark like that? People are pretty wound up about it. Not that they're saying much.
Human female: I heard someone say that they do secret weapons research up there.
Human male: Ah, people say that about every place they're not allowed to go. It's got some big dark secret. How 'bout that lobster?
Human female: Pretty good. Almost tastes like the real thing. Texture's a little off, though.

Human female: You know what I noticed about this place?
Human male: What's that?
Human female: People don't talk. Listen. There's like a dozen people in here. You hear anyone but us?
Human male: There's that salarian on his comm.
Human female: But normally in a place like this, you'd hear--I don't know--I guess "the buzz of conversation?"
Human male: No one can talk about what they did at work. Not without getting sued, anyway.
Human female: Just seems kind of creepy.

Human male: You think you'll take the job?
Human female: I'm considering it.
Human male: So, uh, if you do, you think we might be able to meet sometime? You know. For coffee?
Human female: Coffee? Aw, that's quaint.
Human male: Or dinner. A vid. I don't know.
Human female: You're here for Elanus, right?
Human male: Yeah, I work in superconductors.
Human female: I'm here for Binary Helix. We wouldn't see each other a lot...
Human male: ...unless we both worked on Peak 15.
Human female: Yeah, well, it was nice meeting you.
Human male: Yeah.

Character present:

Rulamin

Rulamin: Don't hang up. Is Luhara Chu Niafahl present? Hello Nia. It's Rulamin. Yes. I'm on Noveria. A job interview with Synthetic Insights. Instructional. I'd swear that every corporation has a former STG operator as their head of Personnel Resources. It's the quietest place I've visited off homeworld. Everything is built with a good view, and there are constables everywhere. Very secure. After I get done here, could we meet? It's been years since we heard each other with our real ears. You're still on Ryskos? Right. I'll do some research tonight and see when I can get a packet there. I'm looking forward to seeing you, too. I'll be in contact as soon as I have plans.

Rulamin: Don't hang up. Ah? That's how salarians greet another over comm channels. Oh, since before we had spaceflight. I think the idea was that you're disturbing the silence. So you want to assure the listener it's important. Look, I'm not an anthropologist. Do you mind? That's all right. I need a packet flight from any groundside port on Noveria to Ryskos. Tomorrow. Really? None at all? Can I assume that's due to security concerns? All right. Six days is the best you can do? Right, that makes sense. All right, I'll see what I can do here. Thanks for your time. Shakni! Wish I'd thought of this sooner.

Rulamin: ...I listen. Apalon? It's been a few weeks, hasn't it? How are things at the office? No. No, they're all on the secure server. Right off the root. Search for fiscals - projections - 2704 - latest. Yes. Right there. Well, I don't know what to tell you. Maybe Laeta deleted them when she moved into my office. Listen, I'm on an interview right now. Noveria. Yes. Well, thanks. Too bad Stoma didn't realize that before he passed me up for promotion. Yes. Good luck with the fiscals.

Rulamin: Don't hang up. Ms. Ellison? It's Rulamin. Well, when I arrived, I found Synthetic Insights had been closed. A criminal conduct investigation. I want you to keep looking for new positions. No. I don't care how the investigation ends. I won't risk my reputation working for a suspect office. All right. When you have some hits, flash them to my VI. He'll collate them for me. Thank you. No, I don't hold this against you. You've done well for me in the past. I'm just-- It's been a long trip for nothing. My trip may be extended. While I'm out here, I have some personal business to see to. We'll speak again.

Pre-recorded announcement: The Aleutsk Valley transit system is closed due to hazardous conditions on the summit. Updates will be broadcast as available. Thank you.

Joker: Normandy online. What's your trouble?

(Par) I need a weather report. (Neu) Any storms near us? (Ren) Weather, they claim.  Shepard: Can you patch into the weather network? Any storms nearby? Shepard: Can you patch into the weather network? Any storms nearby? Shepard: The roads are closed due to weather. Sounds like a bunch of Bravo Sierra to me. Get me a forecast.
Joker: That's an affirmative. We got a monster storm sitting up around the Skadi Range. Blinding snow. Sub-zero temperatures. Gale force winds. Pretty average by local standards.

(Par) Thanks. (Neu) Goodbye. (Ren) That's what I thought.  Shepard: Good work. We'll get back to you, Joker. Shore party out. Shepard: Good work. We'll get back to you, Joker. Shore party out. Shepard: Someone's wasting my time. Thanks for the help. Shore party out.
Joker: Remember: if your feet stop feeling cold, that's a bad sign. Normandy out.

Rachni queen: This one. Serves as our voice. We cannot sing. Not in these low spaces. Your musics are colorless.

(Par) I don't understand you. (Neu) Why aren't you dead? (Ren) Identify yourself.  Shepard: Musics? What?Rachni queen: Your way of communicating is strange. Flat. It does not color the air. When we speak, one moves all.| Urdnot Wrex: This is going to be a fun conversation.| Ashley Williams: This is gonna be a fun conversation.Rachni queen: We are the mother. We sing for those left behind. The children you thought silenced. We are rachni. Shepard: We filled you with enough plasma to pop a tank.Rachni queen: This vessel is at the edge. Yet she struggles. You cannot see her magnificence. We are breathing on the embers. We are the mother. We sing for those left behind. The children you thought silenced. We are rachni. Shepard: Who am I speaking to here?Rachni queen: We are the mother. We sing for those left behind. The children you thought silenced. We are rachni.
(Par) Are you controlling the asari? (Neu) You're some kind of leader? (Ren) You want to talk, be quick.  Shepard: How are you speaking through her?Rachni queen: Our kind sing through touchings of thought. We pluck the strings, and the other understands. She is weak to urging. She has colors we have no names for. But she is ending. Her music is bittersweet. It is beautiful. You are not in harmony with those here. You oppose their green, the one they call "Benezia". Shepard: Did you order your people to kill the science team?Rachni queen: No. We were locked away here. The children are beyond our songs. They have been lost to silence. You are not in harmony with those here. You oppose their green, the one they call "Benezia". Shepard: I didn't come here to talk to bugs.Rachni queen: You are not in harmony with those here. You oppose their green, the one they call "Benezia".
(Neu) Where is she? (Inv) You know who I am?  Shepard: I came here to find her.Rachni queen: Benezia led this child that you've seen through. But she is not here. Benezia hoped to trap you in the spaces where we were hatched. She awaits you there. Shepard: I'm a Spectre, and I'm here to find Benezia.Rachni queen: Spectre... They sang of you. And their voices were silvered with fear. They buried their music for fear of your hearing. Of your... punishment.
(Neu) Where is she? (Ren) Whatever you say.  Shepard: I came here to find her.Rachni queen: Benezia led this child that you've seen through. But she is not here. Benezia hoped to trap you in the spaces where we were hatched. She awaits you there. Shepard: No one sings about me unless it's a dirge. Where's Benezia?Rachni queen: Benezia hoped to trap you in the spaces where we were hatched. She awaits you there.

(Neu) That's a dangerous place. (Ren) We'll make sure she's dead. (Inv) Why did Benezia need you?  Shepard: Maybe she's already dead, then. Shepard: One way or the other, we're going in after her. Shepard: What did the matriach want with you?Rachni queen: Coordinates to... something lost for millenia. Some... memories from our mothers. It is gone now. She took it from us. Squeezed our mind until we forgot, so we could not tell others."| Liara T'Soni: That is... that is forbidden! She intentionally damaged this creature's brain!| Kaidan Alenko: Benezia damaged the part of her brain that held the memory. No human biotic could do that.| Tali'Zorah: I've heard of that. Some powerful biotics can damage parts of a living brain.| Garrus Vakarian: Benezia's more depraved than I thought. She deliberately damaged the rachni's brain.| Urdnot Wrex: Benezia gave her selective brain damage. Handy trick.(Return to last choice)
Rachni queen: That one has a mighty voice. Even we could feel our songs seeking her temples, her rhythms. She tries to sing to our lost children, but their madness is too deep to be soothed.
Shepard: The rachni in the hot labs are... insane?
Rachni queen: The children we birthed were stolen from us before they could learn to sing. They are lost to silence. End their suffering. They cannot be saved. They will only cause harm as they are.
