Description[]
A hydrogen-helium gas giant, Urmola is home to infrastructure that generates both helium-3 and antiprotons. Both sources of fuel are restricted to Hegemony ships, forcing merchant vessels to dock at Bastzuda to refuel before their journey. A sizeable naval station is stationed at Urmola, its ships guarding the installations from enemies without and within. As with other planets in the system, spy satellites are ubiquitous.
EDI'S TRAVEL ADVISORY: The Batarian Hegemony considers any presence of Alliance military vessels in batarian space as hostile. The Normandy SR2, while an independent vessel, strongly resembles the Normandy SR1, an Alliance ship. Use of stealth systems is highly recommended.
