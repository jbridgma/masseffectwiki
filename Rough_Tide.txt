Description[]
A dwarf planet with a shroud of carbon monoxide and dioxide that keeps it warm, Rough Tide was so named when large veins of platinum and palladium were struck and miners from all over the cluster came in to stake their claims. Hanar police and their drell enforcers clashed with krogan and vorcha in an ugly series of race riots in the late 2170s, and the planet has only grudgingly kept a shaky peace since then.
