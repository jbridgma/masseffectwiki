Armax Arsenal has requested help identifying a bug in the combat simulator. Fight a super-elite opponent in their arena on the Citadel.
Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Citadel Docks: Retake the Normandy

Following the conclusion of Shepard's identity theft crisis, the Armax Arsenal Arena opens up along with the rest of Silversun Strip. After winning some matches in the arena and purchasing all available prizes (except the ally licenses), check the Combat Simulator Control terminal for the following e-mail:




Unusual Scores
From: AAA Information Technology Dept.

Commander Shepard,

Here in the arena IT department, we are attempting to isolate a bug in the simulator. The bug causes unusual scores to show up, probably due to a memory leak. We are looking for a competitor who can reliably rack up high scores to serve as a paid consultant for the duration of our tests. We think you would make an excellent baseline!

If you are interested, the aspect that needs testing most is a layout with memory-intensive creatures like the super elite level opponents. Selecting those enemies should help us isolate the leak.

We look forward to working with you.

Walkthrough[]
Select "Super-Elite" level enemies from the Combat Simulator terminal, and complete the match. You may choose any enemy, squadmates, or modifiers for the mission.
After successful completion check the terminal for the following e-mail:




Early Testing Results
From: AAA Information Technology Dept.

Commander Shepard,

Our analysis of your simulator playtest revealed some interesting results. Memory-intensive creatures don't seem to be the problem.

We're thinking the unusual scores might be coming from an error in the bonus-generator code. To help us test, could you enter a match with all the limitations for maximum bonuses? Understandably, you may want to try it with lower-powered opponents.

You will receive a Sniper Rifle High-Velocity Barrel after reading the e-mail. Since the IT team hasn't figured out the problem, do as they ask. Select every positive bonus modifier and complete the match. All other settings regarding enemy type, difficulty, and squad are up to you.

Memory Leak Isolated
From: AAA Information Technology Dept.

Commander Shepard,

Interesting news! The memory leak isn't caused by scoring at all. There's a program running in the background that is siphoning off resources.

We're not certain of the full extent of the errors the program introduces--the running joke is that our arena was constructed on an old Prothean burial ground. We'll need a live test to find out more. Please test the Spin Zone map against geth elites with their enhanced enemy shields enabled. We think that by doing so we'll have a good shot at discovering what the real problem is.

Just as a precaution, we've attached a waiver to this message for you to sign. It's mostly a formality to say your next of kin will not litigate.

See you inside!

You'll be rewarded with the Pistol Power Magnifier weapon mod for your troubles up to this point. Next, change the settings as asked: "Spin Zone" map, "geth" enemies, "elite" difficulty, and "enhanced enemy shields" bonus modifier. You can add other modifiers and choose your squad as you like and start the match.
It looks like they haven't fixed anything at all, and have, in fact, made it worse! The map is filled with incomplete digital artifacts and text reading "Fatal Error," the announcer sounds strange, and the enemies that appear aren't geth at allâ€”they're super-elite level Collectors. The next wave is super-elite level geth, then Cerberus, Reapers, and finally, a combination of all high-level boss enemies: Banshees, Praetorians, Geth Primes, and Atlases all in a single wave. You might find yourself reminiscent about Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer's Platinum difficulty, if you've played it.
If your health and shields fall to zero, it will result in a Critical Mission Failure instead of the normal failed simulations which are not life-threatening. Be careful!


After you've made it through, the IT department will send you a final e-mail and the Assault Rifle Thermal Scope weapon mod. The Fatal Error map also becomes available to use on future arena matches.




Thank you for your service
From: AAA Information Technology Dept.

Commander Shepard,

I wanted to extend our company's sincere apologies that the last test put you in physical danger. We knew there was a potential risk, but we thought we could control the safety levels in case they nulled out. We have never been so wrong.

That said, your efforts managed to let us stabilize the level and we no longer have a memory leak. The simulator scores have been adjusted to their correct levels, putting you at the top of the leaderboard. And the fans seem to have enjoyed the unscripted brush with death.

If you continue to compete in the future, our team is happy to inform you that the layout, "Fatal Error," has now been corrected so feedback is at safe levels. If you'd like to utilize it, we're pretty sure that audiences will tune in again.

Thanks for your service, Commander.
