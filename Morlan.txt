Mass Effect[]
When Commander Shepard hears Dr. Michel is being blackmailed, the Commander can help by delivering medical supplies to Morlan in order to uncover the blackmailer. Morlan gets flustered that Dr. Michel is not the courier, until the blackmailer, a krogan, arrives and snarls "I told Banes you'd screw this up." Once the krogan has been taken care of, Morlan claims to know nothing about Armistan Banes; his only contact was the krogan.







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




Mass Effect 2[]
In 2185, Shepard will eventually receive a message from Morlan, entitled "YOUR 2 SMALL!"
