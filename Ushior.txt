Description[]
An angaran pistol with an incredible punch. The Ushior, translated as "resonance," fires slowly and needs constant reloading, but has massive stopping power. Its plasma energy discharge is likely derivative of kett technology.

Features[]
The Ushior packs a tremendous punch, more than any other handgun in the game. In fact, it deals more damage than most sniper rifles including the Black Widow. It is also extremely accurate. Heavy for a handgun but lightweight compared to full-sized guns, the Ushior is a viable replacement for an actual sniper rifle for players who don't have the weight capacity to spare to carry a Black Widow, M-98 Widow or Isharay at all times. Mounting a Pistol Scope mod maximizes its potential in this battlefield role.
For all its power, the Ushior suffers from a low rate of fire, an extremely small clip size, low spare ammo count and massive recoil, making it unsuited for close quarters combat. At range, careful aim is required as every missed shot leaves Ryder open to retaliation while the player reacquires the target. Installing a high-level Pistol Magazine mod alleviates the clip size issue, but the Ushior still remains a weapon that needs some practice to unlock its full potential.
Singleplayer Ranks I-V use Vanadium for development while Ranks VI-X use Element Zero.
The multiplayer Ushior gained improvements to all stats in its two documented updates. The force it deals also increased from 115 to 550, and the reload speed decreased from 1.75 seconds to 1.25 seconds.

Trivia[]
The Ushior is referred to within the game files as the Zephyr. Remnants of this can be seen in one of Nakmor Drack's emails about angaran guns, as well as a scannable weapons tray at the Angaran Resistance Base hangar on Voeld.
