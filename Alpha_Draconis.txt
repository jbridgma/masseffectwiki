Alpha Draconis consists of one terrestrial world and one gas giant orbiting a white dwarf star. The terrestrial world is a prime colonization prospect, rates rich in mineral deposits particularly platinum, and is one of the known worlds with element zero deposits. The gas giant on the other hand rates poorly in resources.
The system is only recently discovered and is yet to be explored more thoroughly.

Trivia[]
The real-life counterpart of Alpha Draconis, or Thuban, is a star approximately 310 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Draco. The in-game star however is located on the other rim of the Milky Way as seen from our solar system, making it impossible to be seen on Earth's night sky.
The in-game values of the orbital distance and period of the two planets orbiting Alpha Draconis suggest a mass significantly less than the actual mass of the star, which is 3.4 times the mass of the Sun.
The name of this system may be derived from the Greek letter Alpha, and the Latin word for dragon, draconis.
