Equipment are permanent items that can be used by APEX Teams during multiplayer gameplay in Mass Effect: Andromeda. 
These items are the equivalent of Gear from Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer.

Mechanics[]
Equipment is equipped in the weapon Loadout screen to the right of the weapons selections.

One equipment can be equipped per mission.
Equipment can be used repeatedly and does not disappear after the match.
Equipment can be purchased in the Store.
Note:  Structural Ergonomics and Stronghold Package are presently out of rotation from the store. The only reliable way to acquire them after gaining all other equipment is to purchase one of the multiplayer recruit packs: Asari Adept, Krogan Vanguard, Salarian Infiltrator, and/or Turian Soldier. These packs have their own respective equipment as part of the package deal, and since they're already obtained the store will be forced to load other items that have not yet been obtained, in this case either of the last two.
