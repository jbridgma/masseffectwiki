Expat is a volus merchant on the Upper Markets of the Wards. He appears to have a good reputation; another volus nearby claims his is the best store on the Wards to buy upgrades. 
More friendly and cheerful than others of his race, Expat is well-informed about events on human colonies. Commander Shepard can talk to him about Feros and Noveria, learning more about the planets. He has a contact on Feros, and if asked about the planet he notes he hasn't heard anything from him in a while. He doesn't have many clients from Noveria as they all have their own private suppliers. 
In addition to his normal wares, Expat sells armory licenses, namely those for Elkoss Combine and Armax Arsenal.
