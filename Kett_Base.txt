“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The Kett Base is the aliens' command center for their operations on Voeld. Its prominent location atop a large mountain makes it a highly visible feature of the terrain for hundreds of meters around, and it can be seen as far as the hidden Angaran Resistance Base to its northwest.
Assaulting the base and assassinating its Prefect commander considerably lowers kett activity around the planet.


Layout[]
The base technically encompasses the mountain itself, and the attendant kett structures erected around it. The main area is a security center. Should the base go on lockdown, a robust setup requires the destruction of three generators powering the shield around the security terminal that controls the lockdown.
Beside the security center is the primary tower with the Zenith observation room at its top, accessible via elevator. It has the controls for shutting down the whole base as well as the shield around the Ja Niihk Dig Site, which is powered directly by the base through physical conduits connecting it to the site all the way to the north. Below the tower is a hangar, capable of servicing three small ships on platforms cut on the side of the mountain. Automated refueling systems per platform can be overloaded to destroy them, though their controls can be easily locked and may require overriding from any of the myriad consoles in the hangar.
Reaching the base entails going up and around the mountain; scaling the sheer cliffs is nearly impossible even with the Nomad's capabilities. The Kett Tactical Operations Center acts as a lightly-defended gateway between the base and the larger world.
