“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




When Commander Shepard arrives on the Citadel, Haron scans Shepard and is surprised that Citadel records indicate that the Commander is dead. Haron apologizes for the delay and tells Shepard to report to Captain Bailey.
During Commander Shepard's investigation into Thane Krios' son Kolyat, Haron and another C-Sec officer attempts to delay Elias Kelham's lawyer, noting that the criminal's VI was probably programmed to summon the lawyer when a C-Sec officer came within ten meters of him. Later, when Shepard and Thane apprehend Kolyat with his target, Joram Talid, Bailey and Haron are the first officers to arrive at Talid's apartment. Bailey orders Haron at first to take Kolyat into custody, and later to give Thane and Kolyat a private room.
