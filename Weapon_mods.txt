In Mass Effect 3, Weapon Mods are used to augment any of the five types of standard weapon: assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, submachine guns, and heavy pistols. Available mods include high-caliber barrels, scopes, and bayonet attachments, among others. Only two mods can be applied to a weapon at a time, and the same mod cannot be applied twice to a single weapon. For additional information on the various mods see the notes section below.
Once a weapon mod is found, it may be applied to any and all of the weapons of the applicable type at a weapon bench. Finding another instance of a mod the player already possesses will upgrade that mod to the next level. Likewise, shops will always carry mods one level above those the player currently has.
Legendary Edition:  Any listed single-player DLC requirements for obtaining mods are only applicable if not playing Mass Effect Legendary Edition, as all previously available single-player DLC is included in Legendary Edition by default. Orange notations are present where applicable to draw attention to this.

Player Notes
Extended Barrel and High Caliber Barrel mod's damage bonus stacks additively with that provided by skills such as class or racial passives and powers. For example, an Infiltrator Shepard who took every weapon damage upgrade for Operational Mastery and Tactical Cloak and put a High Caliber Barrel V mod on his weapon will deal 100% + 10% + 90% + 25% = 225% of base damage.
Piercing, Shredder, and High-Velocity mods increase damage versus armored targets by ignoring part of damage reduction that every bullet striking an armored target suffers. Think of it as a fixed amount of extra damage on every bullet or shotgun pellet striking an armored target. As a result, rapid-fire weapons with a low damage-per-shot receive a much greater benefit from these mods than slow-firing high damage-per-shot guns. Due to the in-game phrasing, some players may be mislead into thinking that these anti-armor mods reduce damage per shot to all targets. In fact, the 'reduced damage' wording only means that enemies shot through solid objects (e.g. armor plating, terrain, or other enemies) do not receive the full potential damage. Targets without any cover or armor still receive the normal allotment of damage.
The following weapons fire rounds that penetrate objects by default: the N7 Crusader, the N7 Typhoon, the Javelin, the Executioner Pistol, the M-98 Widow, and the Black Widow. The native penetration of these weapons does not suffer a damage penalty from equipping Piercing or Shredder mods. In multiplayer, Drill and Armor-Piercing Rounds likewise provide penetration to weapons without a damage penalty for shooting through objects unless said mods are equipped.
High-Velocity Barrel mods: upon getting them to level 5 (V) for sniper rifles and shotguns, the Extended Barrel mods effectively become weaker (though lighter) choices, since the latter only gives damage, as opposed to damage and pierce. Combined with a Piercing/Shredder mod, and a weapon with natural piercing abilities, one can penetrate unthinkably large amounts of cover and headshot enemies from as much as 3.7-4 metres.[8]
Characters seeking faster recharge speeds for their powers, however, may still prefer the Extended Barrel Mod, as all High-Velocity Barrels add 50% weight onto the character.
Spare Thermal Clip ammunition mods tend to be more useful on weapons that have very little ammunition on reserve, such as the Reegar Carbine, or the M-98 Widow. While it is also helpful with weapons with a much larger reserve such as the M-13 Raptor, its effects are usually unnecessary unless playing against enemies on harder difficulties.
Extended Magazine Upgrade mods do not change the amount of spare ammo a weapon holds; however, the increased capacity is not deducted from the spare ammo pool either - if a weapon normally holds 100 rounds and 500 in reserve, applying a Magazine Upgrade V will change that to 180 rounds and 500 in reserve, for a total of 680.
Power magnifier mods only enhance the damage of powers when the weapon with the mod is actually selected and being held out by the player, not when "holstered."
Omni-Blade and other melee damage enhancing mods apply the melee damage bonus while holding a weapon with this mod attached (i.e. having the weapon actually selected, not just equipped), even if the character's melee animations don't actually strike with the visible blade or attachment of the mod.
For example: the drell and krogan light melee, the geth and asari heavy melee, or the N7 Shadow Infiltrator's and N7 Paladin Sentinel's light melee may not trigger the sound and/or hit effects associated with the mod but the damage is still benefiting from it.
When using any scope mods, caution should be advised since these also decrease your peripheral vision, making it easier to be surprised by an unexpected flanking enemy. They also automatically reduce your targeting sensitivity while scoped which can throw off your aim and make it very difficult to track moving targets that aren't far away. This is especially noticeable with the Assault Rifle Thermal Scope.
NPC squad members do not utilize or benefit from scopes in any way; they can automatically detect and track any uncloaked targets, even through walls and smoke screens, and while they can miss shots, they are quite accurate overall.
