Mass Effect Legendary Edition Achievements/Trophies[]
These achievements are a mix of slightly modified achievements from the original trilogy and new achievements specific to the Legendary Edition that span all three games.
A list of these achievements can be found in the Origin launcher.
Note:  Unlike in the original Mass Effect, the "Mastery" and "Specialist" achievements in Legendary Edition can be unlocked through the use of squadmate abilities. This means that having Liara and Tali as squadmates will allow you to unlock almost all of the power-specific achievements and their respective bonus talents in a single playthrough, regardless of the player's own class (aside from Neural Shock, which is only available for Kaidan Alenko, as well as the Engineer and Sentinel classes).
