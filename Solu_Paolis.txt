Description[]
Solu Paolis's helium-3 collection mechanisms historically turned a large profit, not because of any great immigration into the Esori system, but because Solu Paolis made a good refueling stop between Irune and Satu Arrd.
Warned of the Reapers' battle plans but left with little other option, a select team of workers at Solu Paolis sent out phony communications suggesting that important military data was being handed off here. When the Reapers sent in a force of husks, they ran into the volus's trap: a chain reaction that annihilated the station.
