Trivia[]
The Ninmah Cluster is likely named after the Sumerian earth goddess Ninhursag, also referred to as Ninmah. Most celestial objects in the cluster apparently have names derived from ancient Mesopotamian mythologies.
Although the Ninmah Cluster has no adjacent directly explorable clusters in Mass Effect 3, the cluster it's connected to is approximately at the same place as Hawking Eta.
