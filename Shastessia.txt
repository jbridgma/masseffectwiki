Description[]
A hydrogen-helium gas giant, Shastessia is a twin to its more massive neighbor Medokos in more than once sense. The two are named for a semi-mythological pair of twins from asari antiquity who ruled neighboring city-states and had a lifelong dialog about the best form of government. As the legend goes, Shastessia died before her vision of a democratic republic could be realized. Her sister, Medokos, then took up the cause, sacrificing personal power so that all free landowners in her city would have a voice. Although historians doubt that the changes were entirely altruistic, pointing to uprisings that demanded representation, the development was a step towards modern asari government.
