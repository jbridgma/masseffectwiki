Description[]
A so-called "hot Neptune" planet, Echidna rapidly orbits the star Typhon at a nose-to-nose distance much like a pegasid, or "hot Jupiter." Also like the pegasids, it is believed to have formed further out and gradually migrated to its present position. Its core is higher in rock content than Sol's Neptune, the consequence of attracting asteroids and other debris as it journeyed through its solar system.
