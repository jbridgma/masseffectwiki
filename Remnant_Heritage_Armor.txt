Description[]
This armor was designed from scratch by the Initiative using Remnant technology. Its servos, microframe computer, and kinetic barrier generators are all dependent on Remnant science and artifacts. This resilient and regenerative hardsuit has an energy surplus, though its internal systems can be difficult to properly monitor. 

At Ranks III - X, the existing description changes to remove a portion of the last sentence and adds the following text: "Upgrades allow for finer computer control of all internal systems."
Types[]
Ranks I - X are named Remnant Heritage when the four armor pieces are crafted.
When the four armor pieces are found in-game:

Ranks I-II are named Remnant Legacy.
Ranks III-IV are named Remnant Heritage.
Ranks V-X are named Remnant Reborn.
Note:  There are no differences between the found versions compared to the crafted versions (other than visual).
