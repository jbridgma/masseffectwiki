Firebase Derelict is a map in Mass Effect: Andromeda's multiplayer mode. It is located in the interior of an abandoned kett ship.
Description[]
This kett ship is adrift in the Scourge. Symbolically important to the kett, its databanks are also full of the information valuable to those who can decipher it. Damage to the ship requires sections to be sealed off and re-opened for the militia to proceed, gathering information before they meet an extraction shuttle.
