Inspiration
To: Ryder
From: Cora

Ryder,

I thought about our talk, after the Leusinia. Got some inspiration. Come and chat next time we're both on the ship?


Cora


Speak to Cora on the Tempest[]
Cora Harper requests a favor from you.

If you refuse at this time, she'll ask the same question again the next time you speak to her.
If you accept, Cora says that she was thinking about Sarissa Theris, how Cora wasn't made a Pathfinder herself, and that has given her an idea for a project. She wants Ryder to accompany her to a site on Eos.
Go to Eos with Cora[]
Go to the navpoint  located in Fairwinds Basin (northeast of the Forward Station in the middle of the lake) and talk to Cora. 
Cora has brought a soil converter. Eventually the converter will turn sand into something useful, and then with some rain and seeds, it will be a garden. Not for a long, long time, perhaps, but like the asari, Cora has learned to think in the long term. Ryder and Cora then seed the garden.
If you flirted with Cora before and hasn't already locked in a romance, it is possible in this mission to take the opportunity (with a kiss interrupt) or to reject her.

Aftermath[]
Depending upon your romance choice during the mission, one of two emails will show up:
Non-Romantic Choice:




Garden
To: Ryder
From: Cora 

Thanks again for coming with me. If you want to know, the plants we seeded are...

— Tiral azhana, "handful of water," a plant from Rannoch
— Common irsaal, a Thessian blossom that smells like honey
— Lace-in-lilac, a flower they found on Eden Prime

... and a few others.


Cora.

And before I forget... that was one amazing kiss, mister. Could have been a fluke, though. Guess we have to keep trying.


Cora.
