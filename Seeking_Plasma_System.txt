Compatibilities[]
Guns - This augmentation can be applied to gun-type weapons.
Description[]
Changes weapon projectile to seeking plasma bolts.

Mechanics[]
The Seeking Plasma System augmentation SHOULD NOT be combined with the Plasma Charge System. The Plasma Charge system interferes with the functionality of the Seeking Plasma System. 

Strategies[]
Works well with inaccurate weapons such as scatter shot weapons. Slows projectiles, but causes them to home in on targets.  The increased travel time causes the projectiles to be less effective at longer ranges, as enemies are more likely to take cover or move out of the way before impact.
