Description[]
Technically named T'hooft [sic] (Dutch for "the head"), Thooft is a dwarf planet with a moderate carbon dioxide atmosphere and rich deposits of periclase. Originally put on the star charts when a human scout ship needed to discharge its drive core and wasn't able to reach the system's gas giants in time, Thooft has seen some development by Hoshichiri Heavy Industries. Periclase from the asteroid can be found in common industrial products, such as industrial cable insulation and fire-resistant prefab housing walls.

Trivia[]
The planet may be named after Gerardus 't Hooft, a Dutch theoretical physicist and winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in physics, along with his teacher Martinus Veltman.
T'hooft is actually not the exact way to write the head in modern Dutch. The correct way is "het/'t hoofd", with the apostrophe before the 't', since " 't " is short for "het" ("the"), and ending the noun with a 'd'. "Hooft" is archaic.
In the region West Flanders in Belgium, "T'hooft" would be the correct way of saying "The head".
