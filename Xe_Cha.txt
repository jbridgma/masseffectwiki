Xe Cha is a gateway system. Its planets have volus names.
It is home to a civilization or civilizations that were wiped out by some targeted cataclysm before the coming of the current Citadel races. The volus have even discovered remnants of a uranium mining station that's about 50,000 years old, or dating roughly from the time of the Protheans. Consequently, the system rates moderate to rich in resources and can also be mined for element zero.
A Galactic News Network announcer pronounced the name of the system as 'shay chah' (ʃeɪ ʧɑː).
