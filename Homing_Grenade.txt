Player Notes[]
Grenade powers do not have a recharge time and, thus, can be used immediately at any time, provided grenades are available. Using the power consumes one grenade each time.
The N7 Demolisher Engineer has two grenade powers, which both share the same pool.
As the name would suggest, this ability does track its target in a slow-moving animation similar to projectile powers such as Incinerate or Warp.
Homing Grenade is deployed from the omni-tool rather than being thrown, and the cast animation is fairly long, which can expose the user to a lot of enemy fire.
The grenade travels relatively slowly compared to other grenades, but can also reach much farther.
The slow-moving nature of the grenade also means that it is more accurate than other homing projectiles against enemies with dodging abilities, since the grenade can correct its course to continue homing in on them more easily than projectile powers. Conversely, due to the slow projectile speed Phantoms, Banshees, and Praetorians are more likely to use their deflection powers to block it.
Homing Grenade's travel path often arcs quite high in the air after it's deployed, especially over long distances, which can give it a tendency to hit intervening terrain like roofs and ceilings.
This grenade is capable of staggering all targets hit by the explosion. This can be especially useful for saving allies from enemy sync kills.
This grenade is considered a tech power and thus benefits from both power and tech damage bonuses.
Using this grenade immediately after an Arc Grenade (with the "Electrical Damage" evolution) will trigger a powerful Tech Burst.
The Rank 5 Fire Damage evolution does not prime targets for Fire Explosions.
The Rank 6 Split Grenade evolution is able to detonate two Power Combos per projectile.
Either each grenade projectile hits a separate enemy primed for a valid combo (fire, cryo, or tech), or
Each projectile can detonate a combo on the same target, provided there are at least two separate, valid priming effects active on said target. It can be difficult to force both projectiles to hit the same target unless it is at very close range or the only target in the area.
A combo may fail to detonate if the grenade projectile's damage alone is sufficient to kill the primed target.
Availability[]
Single-player: N/A
Multiplayer: Drell Assassin Infiltrator, N7 Demolisher Engineer,  Turian Saboteur Engineer
Bugs[]
With the Fire Damage evolution, Homing Grenade has a buggy interaction with Incendiary Ammo (which itself has a buggy interaction with itself); both erroneously use the same damage effect, and once Incendiary Ammo is applied on an enemy under the effect of Homing Grenade, both damage-over-time effects get combined into an overly-damaging 3 second damage-over-time that is still technically considered by the game as "Homing Grenade", making the ammo use Homing Grenade's damage modifiers, which will let Incendiary Ammo do damage to shields and barriers.[1] In addition, the buggy damage-stacking of Incendiary Ammo will still work, multiplying the effect.
