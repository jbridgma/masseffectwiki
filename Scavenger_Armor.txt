Description[]
The Auto-Recycling Technical and Combat Interface Armor-a name only slightly less awkward in the original turian-is better known as the Scavenger Hardsuit. Originally built by Armax Arsenal in the Milky Way, the Scavenger incorporates quarian technology that allows the user to better analyze, interface, and integrate foreign components. A handful of these suits were given to the Andromeda Initiative by an anonymous turian donor.

Types[]
The Scavenger Armor set can only be crafted and is not found in-game.
