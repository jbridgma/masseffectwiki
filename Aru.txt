Prerequisite: Priority: Tuchanka (Mass Effect 3)


The volus home system's planetary infrastructures evolved to service the race's mercantile needs. Locil has a bustling conglomeration of orbital habitats centered around helium-3 production, while Cherk Sab is a secondary helium-3 source. Doldit's moons house research centers of Irune corporations to avoid regulatory concerns on the homeworld's environment. 
However, these are all for naught with the invasion of the Reapers, who promptly demolished the facilities in space. Irune in particular is vulnerable to ground assault as its cities are optimized for trade rather than defensibility. The Reapers have not yet gone through Cherk Sab and its space is filled with volus ships trying to escape the system.
