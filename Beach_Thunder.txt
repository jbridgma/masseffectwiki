Description[]
Beach Thunder lives and dies on the price of titanium, the metal being the only reason to come to this frozen rock. A best-selling e-novel, "The Hard Stuff," has popularized the story of the miners on the planet. It follows the hanar and drell robo-miners competing with krogan and vorcha who simply put on environment suits and lase the titanium out more or less by hand. As the novel's promotional screed says, "accidents are frequent, rivalry is fierce, and vengeance served up fast."
