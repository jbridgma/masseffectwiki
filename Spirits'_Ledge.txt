Spirits' Ledge is a deep valley southeast of the mountain where Kadara Port is situated. It is bounded to the northeast by Haarfel. 
Rugged wilderness through and through, it has one Forward Station in the narrow passage to the southeast lands. Numerous large wildlife can be seen stalking the area like rylkor and eirochs, as well as smaller beasts like adhi.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The region contains a collection of exile structures to the far southeast that are nominally abandoned. Some of these structures were used by the Collective as interrogation/torture sites. Various outlaw factions patrol the place, resulting in a free-for-all between the local wildlife, the Outcasts, the Collective, unaffiliated outlaws, and/or Pathfinder Ryder should any of these teams meet.
