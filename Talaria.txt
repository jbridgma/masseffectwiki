Description[]
A rock with all traces of atmosphere burned away, Talaria orbits the star Hoplos at a blistering pace: every 36 days. Though tidally locked, even its twilight belt and shaded side are too barren to support life. With so many resources on its sister planet Trident, Talaria has largely been ignored by the galactic surveying community.
