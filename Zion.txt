Description[]
Zion is a hydrogen-helium gas giant even larger than Jupiter. Despite its deep gravity well and lethal radiation, it supports a small helium-3 mining industry. The reason is simple: as the only gas giant in the Utopia system, it is the only local source for fuel for Eden Prime's power stations and spaceports.
Zion has 112 satellites, ranging from orbiting asteroids to the moon of Asphodel, which is large enough to retain a thick atmosphere.

Trivia[]
Zion refers specifically to an area around Mount Zion in Israel where King David conquered a Jebusite fortress. It has also been used as a figure of speech to refer to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, or to the Holy Land in general.
Asphodel may be named after a flower of Hades and sacred to Persephone.
