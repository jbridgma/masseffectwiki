Onyx Armor is one of Aldrin Labs' armor lines. It is used by Alliance special forces personnel; both Commander Shepard and Kaidan Alenko wear it as default. In all its variations, its stats appear inferior to most other armors due to the use of kinetic plastite.[1]

Trivia[]
The N7 design of this armor (as worn by Commander Shepard) is available in t-shirt form from the Bioware website.[2]
The N7 design of the armor and helmet are available to purchase separately for your Xbox Live Avatar at a price of US $3.99 for the "N7 Armor" and US $1.99 for the "N7 Helmet".
The red stripes that appear on Shepard's Onyx Armor are possibly a reference to the suits worn by astronauts on the Apollo Program. Commanders wore red stripes to distinguish them from their teammates[3] According to trilogy director Casey Hudson in The Art of Mass Effect, the red stripe also symbolises the human blood Shepard has to sacrifice to save the galaxy.
Shepard wears the heavy version of the armor (regardless of any prior proficiencies or lack thereof in the first game) at the beginning of Mass Effect 2. While searching for the Commander, Legion fixed themselves with the right shoulder pauldron and plates of the armor after they found its remains in Alchera.
