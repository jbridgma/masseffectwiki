Mass Effect[]
The Fedele's cargo hold is full of mindless Test Subjects (resembling Thorian Creepers) who attack Commander Shepard's squad on sight. There are also crates stocked with weapons and wetware in the room with Dr. Saleon. 
The ship's owner, a salarian, can be found in one of the compartments, and thanks Shepard for rescuing him from "those things". If Garrus Vakarian is with the squad, he can identify the salarian as Dr. Saleon, and ask the commander for a chance to get payback. Shepard can either deny Garrus' request and kill Saleon, or let Garrus get his payback. Saleon refuses to be taken and tries to run away, but Saleon is killed in the attempt.
