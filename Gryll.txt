Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven

Speak to Aria at the Purgatory on the Citadel.

Walkthrough[]
Aria will tell you to meet with her batarian contact, Narl, on the Presidium Commons. Go to Apartment 86. Narl explains to Shepard that he told the Blood Pack he's turning the Commander over to Kreete, a vorcha Blood Pack leader, but Narl also adds that this is a lie. 


The real goal is to lure the Blood Pack out since Kreete is planning to betray Aria. Narl needs Shepard to play along and pretend to be captured. You can respond positively or negatively to this request for mandatory morality points, but either way you'll end up going along with it.
Then three vorcha arrive, one of whom is Kreete. As they are about to seal the deal, Narl reveals that the deal is between Aria and Gryll, to Kreete's surprise. Gryll, who's next-in-line to assume leadership, confirms the deal and orders the kill on Kreete. Shepard and Narl will then shoot Kreete and the unnamed vorcha present. After the kill, Shepard advises Gryll not to double-cross Aria. He agrees, stating he's ambitious, but not crazy.
At this point the mission is complete and your Terminus Fleet War Asset will be updated. You are also awarded 210 experience, 5,000 credits, 5 Reputation points, and the aforementioned morality points.
