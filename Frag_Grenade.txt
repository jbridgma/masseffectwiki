Player Notes[]
Grenade powers do not have a recharge time and can be used immediately at any time provided grenades are available. Using the power consumes one grenade each time.
If the player has multiple grenade powers, the grenade pool is shared between them.
As with all grenades, Frag Grenades are effective at taking out groups of weaker enemies. The detonation will also stagger most lighter enemies in the blast zone that aren't killed outright. They are also useful for bouncing or arcing around terrain to hit enemies hiding behind cover.
Frag Grenades thrown by players usually detonate 1 second after they come into contact with a horizontal surface, and they detonate instantly on hitting an enemy directly. When used by squadmates in single-player, they not only detonate instantly but travel instantly as well.
Frag Grenades can detonate all non-biotic Power Combos (tech, fire, and cryo) but they can't set up, or "prime," combos of any type.
Note that the Rank 6 Shield Overload evolution only increases damage to shields, not barriers, unlike with most powers with similar evolutions.
Though this power is available to Admiral Anderson during the prologue, he will have no grenades, rendering it useless.
