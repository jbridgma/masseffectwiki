Draullir ("death caves" in Shelesh) is another mountainous region in Kadara. It is bounded to the north and east by Sulfur Springs, and to the west by the mountain range where Kadara Port is situated. 
Unlike the nearby regions, Draullir is mostly known for the cave systems inside its mountains. Such caves often have sulfurous cesspools and high levels of toxic gas, which further act as deterrent against exploration, though the danger is mitigated if one knows where they're going.
One of the three Remnant monoliths of the planet is also situated here. Several large animals like rylkor and eirochs can be found wandering the caves or outside them.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Draullir's naturally spacious cave systems have been rated as particularly good smuggler hideouts. They're popular locations for furtive meetups or confrontations requiring privacy. Other factions have also made their homes there: the Collective, the Roekaar, and kett stragglers from Kadara Port all have bases inside the mountains in three separate cave systems.
