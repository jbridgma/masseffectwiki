Fortack is the Lord High Researcher of Clan Urdnot and owner of Fortack's Database on Tuchanka. He was forced to kill his predecessor before gaining his title.






“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




If Urdnot Wrex is the leader of Clan Urdnot, Fortack will rant at Commander Shepard about his talents being wasted by the clan leader, having him research "things that don't explode", such as crop genetics and medical improvements, which can easily be bought from the salarians, according to Fortack. On the other hand, if Urdnot Wreav leads the clan, then Fortack will be working on things that explode, saying there's always space for more weapons on Tuchanka. In either event, Fortack will welcome Grunt after his rite of passage into Clan Urdnot (or if Grunt is not in the party, Shepard as Grunt's krantt). He will note that the Shaman granted the customary upgrades for completing the Rite, and that the Shaman is quick to pass off such rewards without giving Fortack due credit.
