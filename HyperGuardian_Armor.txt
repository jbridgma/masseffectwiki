Description[]
HyperGuardian hardsuits were built by Kassa Fabrication as a civilian-friendly alternative to the Colossus line intended for private security in heavy-fire situations or extreme environmental conditions. The Initiative considered the bulky and unbreakable HyperGuardian a perfect choice for protecting vulnerable new colonies.

Types[]
Ranks I - X are named HyperGuardian when the four armor pieces are crafted or found in-game.
Note:  There are no differences between the crafted versions compared to the found versions.

Player Notes[]
Features[]
HyperGuardian armor has the highest health and shield bonuses available to Ryder through armor.

Strategies[]
While other armor sets may support Ryder's use of weapons or skills, HyperGuardian armor boosts protection to Ryder's two basic innate defenses: shields/barrier and health. 
When used as a complete set, HyperGuardian armor works best for playing styles favoring versatility and survivability over total commitment to Biotics, Tech, or Combat. Given that Ryder can build access to powerful profiles, HyperGuardian armor allows Ryder greater flexibility in switching between profiles without seeing large gaps in performance. 
The armor works best if heavily invested early in the game, as it will take time to grow Ryder's skills and profiles. Because of the base boosts to health and shields, without any overt bonuses to powers, the armor synergizes best with the 'mixed' profiles of Infiltrator, Vanguard, and Sentinel. Infiltrators will benefit from greater ability to stay in place for precision aiming, Vanguards for the ability to take damage while working in close, and Sentinels for the increased damage protection already afforded by the class. 
Along similar lines, players may find that the armor works well with the Explorer profile by complimenting the all-around versatility of the power bonuses; players who have dispersed skill points across Biotic, Tech, and Combat powers should strongly consider choosing powers enhanced by the profile. 
The greatest weakness of the HyperGuardian armor is a byproduct of its initial utility; as players grow in their play style, the extra damage protection may become less important than recharge speed and damage benefits, and other armor sets, such as the Angaran, Kett, and N7 armors are better suited toward specialist roles. 
As with all of Ryder's armor, players can mix-and-match different armors for balancing traits, and using the crafting option can imbue the armor with other important features and bonuses.
