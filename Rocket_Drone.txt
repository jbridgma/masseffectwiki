Rocket Drones are autonomous drones equipped with rocket launchers, used in 2185 to guard certain areas.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Rocket Drones typically attack from a distance and at varying heights above the ground. They will often move around to flank enemies.
Defensive
Most Rocket Drones only possess shielding; once they go down, they are gone. The Rocket Drones on Kopis have health in addition to shields, but this does little to help their survivability. They obviously cannot take cover, but they're very manoeuvrable to compensate.

Tactics[]
Because Rocket Drones only possess shields, using powers and weapons that damage shields quickly are recommended. Powers like Overload and Disruptor Ammo that are good at ripping apart shields are great weapons against these flying enemies.
Because they are flying enemies, they are immune to some biotic powers, so if you are going up against them, be sure to bring along a tech expert if you aren't one yourself.
On Kopis, the Hammerhead is used to fight the Drones. As the Drones' rockets are not guided, they can be easily avoided by moving while firing the Hammerhead's guided missiles at them.
Because Rocket Drones like to attack in swarms and are highly mobile, they are often able to flank your cover position so keep an eye on them and try not to get too close.
During the Lair of the Shadow Broker, Rocket Drones that appear are affected by Singularity and will fly in circles, making them easier to target.  Stasis will instantly destroy them.
Trivia[]
In Legion: A House Divided, Shepard can override inactive rocket drones and use them to fight the geth at the Heretic Station.
The rocket drones present in the assignments Project Firewalker: Survey Sites Located and Project Firewalker: Prothean Site resemble the Geth Rocket Drone from the original Mass Effect.
