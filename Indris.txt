Indris is a batarian-controlled system exploited only relatively recently. Its planets have been discovered in the 2050s but settled only in the 2150s. Its main draw is the vast eezo wealth of Camala, though population centers mining other resources also exist on Cholis and Ramlat.
The system is heavily hit by the Reapers during their initial assault on the galaxy. Most population centers and military installations like Kaver Station have been destroyed, while Camala is turned into a production hub for Cannibals.
