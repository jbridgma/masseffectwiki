Description[]
A large rock planet, Ansuz was once under development by a consortium of robo-mining interests, but an epidemic of accidents and sabotage cost the lives of hundreds of workers and eventually drove them off the world. Despite numerous accusations among the mining corporations and a dozen or more trials, popular opinion holds that the real saboteurs were never found.

Trivia[]
Ansuz was named after the reconstructed Proto-Germanic name for one of the letters of the Elder Futhark runic alphabet. It refers to an óss, any of the Æsir gods worshipped by the ancient Germanic peoples and some modern pagans, including the Norse.
