Harrot's Emporium can be found in the Omega Marketplace. On occasion, an ad for the store plays on public speakers wherein two women discuss things they bought from the emporium and debunking some misconceptions about the store. Harrot himself concludes the ad with restrained exasperation that his emporium is not just boring junk "anymore."

Discount[]
Commander Shepard can obtain a discount on the shop's items by helping Kenn to get off Omega. Harrot must be persuaded to deal with the quarian, and in return the elcor offers a discount to his own shop.

1 If not picked up during the mission

During Aria T'Loak's campaign to recapture Omega from Cerberus in 2186, Harrot is forced into hiding. He is later discovered by some of Aria's troops and brought to Aria's Bunker, where he briefly re-opens his shop.
Harrot's inventory consists of Weapon Mods. The second, more expensive, upgrade of each weapon mod is available after the purchase of the first.
Despite not being located on the Citadel, Citadel store discounts obtained from intel items will still apply to Harrot's Emporium on Omega.
After completing the Mass Effect 3: Omega DLC, you won't be able to access Harrot's Emporium again. However, the items will be available from the stores in the Citadel (and by extension, the Normandy's Procurement Interface).
