Thermal Armor is produced by Devlon Industries. It is produced only for turians.
It is environmentally sealed: if Garrus Vakarian is present and wearing Thermal Armor, it will negate the timer on environments with Level 1 environmental hazards and slow down the timer on Level 2. However, in consequence, all of the armor's stats are lower than most armors produced by other manufacturers.[1]
