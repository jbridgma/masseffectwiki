Immunity[]
 When activated, Immunity reduces most damage done to health (not shields) by a set percentage, making it useful when shields are down, or when taking damage from sources that shields don't mitigate such as explosive damage from rockets or other types of physical damage. Immunity is also used by powerful krogan (and on higher difficulties, human and turian) enemies when they take damage; its activation is indicated by the user's health bar turning white. 
Immunity is a very powerful ability especially at high levels where it can be kept active almost indefinitely. Immunity can be countered if the user is stunned or immobilized before it can be activated, or if the user is hit with a power that reduces damage resistance such as Warp or Overload. Immunity also does not protect against the electrical attacks of Husks as they are tech-based. Just like enemies, squadmates with Immunity only activate it once they take damage to their health, so it can be wise to manually order them to activate it just prior to entering combat especially against hard-hitting enemies.

Immunity (Legendary Edition)[]
 Unlike in the original Mass Effect, Immunity in Legendary Edition has a fixed duration and cooldown of six and forty-five seconds respectively. It can no longer be kept active continuously, though it provides comparatively higher damage resistance. In every other respect it behaves as it did in the original game. The vastly reduced duration means that Immunity should now be saved for use in especially dangerous situations, such as when engaging enemy snipers or when powerful melee opponents such as krogan are able to close with you.
