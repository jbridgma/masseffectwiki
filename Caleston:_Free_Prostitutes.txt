Caleston: Free Prostitutes is an assignment in Mass Effect which was cut during development. However, unlike other known Caleston missions and assignments, no dialogue relating to this assignment has been retrieved.

Acquisition[]
This assignment would have been acquired through talking to the various prostitutes on Caleston, namely Maddie Kedward (for a male Shepard), Matthew Baudelaire (for a female Shepard), or possibly Tatiana Naidenov. It would stop being available once Shepard has left Throw Down in search of Liara T'Soni.

Plotline[]
After having "heard of the problem", Shepard is told to talk to Sessa Tarrent to offer to buy the prostitutes' contracts, which would solve the issue at hand. Alternatively, another way to free the prostitutes would be to "ask" Administrator Tombiri at a certain point during Caleston: Last Man Standing. Finally, if Tombiri stops being the administrator in any way (whether because she's killed, arrested, or otherwise missing), the prostitutes can also be considered free. Shepard however still has to inform the prostitutes of either of these outcomes for the assignment to complete.
