Description[]
A rock planet exploited for minerals by robo-miners, Pania was named for an ancient mythological asari hero. Her music was so stirring the goddess Athame granted Pania anything her heart desired. Differing legends reflect the variety of hero cults of the time: in some stories, she became the first ruler of Armali, while others claim Pania took to the stars with Athame herself.
The robo-miners' orbital stations here have been destroyed. A number of life pods can be detected, but most are in the red, indicating that their oxygen ran out long ago.
