“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The Nexus Docking Bay is located along the interior of the station's central torus. The Tempest lands here whenever Pathfinder Ryder visits the station.
Layout[]
The Docking Bay is adjacent to the Common Area. Tram transport services list the Docking Bay as a catch-all for both places. The lower entrance of the Cultural Exchange is located here, as well as a nearby Avina terminal and a queue for immigration processing.
Vetra Nyx often loiters here while off-duty. The journalist Keri T'Vessa can also be found here whenever she has a need to interview the Pathfinder.
From the door leading to the Tempest, there's a Heleus News Service terminal at the opposite end.
