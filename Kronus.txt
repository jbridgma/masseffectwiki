Mass Effect: Blasto: Eternity is Forever


Kronus is a fictional krogan character featured in the Blasto adventure "Blasto: Eternity is Forever". Kronus was once incarcerated on a prison ship by Blasto, but killed the crew and escaped. Three Spectres were sent after him, but each one turned up dead.
Kronus establishes a base on Virmire, the perfect hiding spot because the galaxy believes the planet to be uninhabitable after a nuclear blast occurred. There, Kronus constructs a machine capable of freezing time, which he plans to use to take over the galaxy. When Blasto and his partner Cerulean Star arrive, Kronus freezes Blasto with his gauntlet and his guards capture Cerulean Star. The asari frees herself, however, and forces Kronus to un-freeze Blasto at gunpoint. His plan thwarted, Kronus activates the base's self-destruct sequence, flings one of his guards at Blasto as a distraction, and attempts to flee. An explosion knocks him over a railing and he plummets to his death.
