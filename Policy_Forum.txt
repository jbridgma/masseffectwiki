Welcome to the Policy Forum. Here is where various discussions about policy for the Mass Effect Wiki can be discussed and voted on. Here you bring up something that needs to be addressed and it needs to be made official, or suggest a change to a current policy. Note that this forum is a community forum about official policy for the Mass Effect Wiki, some topics will be passed, and others rejected.
In order to create or vote on a policy proposal, you must have a valid account with Mass Effect Wiki that is at least 30 days old. This waiting period is to ensure that new users have enough time to understand existing wiki policies. Any proposals made by unregistered contributors or accounts that are less than 30 days old will be deleted, but may be re-proposed after the mandatory cooldown period (see below) if the proposer then meets the account requirement.
Once a topic has begun, a vote will last for 7 days, ending at the time indicated on the template at the top of the page. At that time, any further votes cast after the close of the debate will not be counted in the final tally. To vote, leave a quick reason why and sign your post under the appropriate heading. If you wish to discuss, then do so under the discussion section, not in the voting section. When Voting, don't indent every new vote, just leave it on the next line. Once a topic has been passed or rejected the page is for archive purposes only, not to restart a debate.
If a topic needs to be reopened, a mandatory 7 day waiting or cooldown period must be adhered to. This is to test out the new policy and see what its effects are. Once the 7-day period is up, start a new discussion, do not continue the old one as the old page is for archive purposes only.
If any user is found to be fraudulent, or to have canvassed for votes on a policy, their vote and any votes gained through this will be invalidated. The user who committed the action will face a block, depending on how often this has been done in the past, and will not be allowed to vote in the next policy forum debate. By debate, that means one with an actual proposal is needed.
If you need an example on how to vote or discuss, see Forum:Example.
