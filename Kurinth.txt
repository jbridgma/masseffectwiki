Description[]
Wrapped in a crushing haze of hydrogen and methane, Kurinth is named for an asari goddess of war and hunting, the two being similar in the asari mindset. The planet is particularly bright in Thessia's morning and evening skies, enough to cast noticeable shadows on moonless nights. Understandably, warriors and hunters operating at night were grateful for Kurinth's blessing.
The planet was never heavily exploited for minerals; early asari explorers focused on the asteroid belt and by the time robo-mining machines were created that could withstand the intense heat, more lucrative planets were already on the star charts. Modern charts record several scientific stations orbiting the planet, but it appears that all have been destroyed by the Reapers.

Trivia[]
The planet's eponym lends its name to an asari yoga pose and a region in Kadara.
