Description[]
After the development of mass effect FTL drive, distant Uranus was the target of a "land rush" to exploit its combination of plentiful helium-3 fuel and shallow (for a gas giant) gravity well. Today Uranus is the largest producer of He-3 in Alliance space.

Trivia[]
The in-game information for Mass Effect incorrectly gives the orbital period of Uranus as 121.1 years; it is actually 84.3 years. This is corrected in Mass Effect 2.
Sakharov Station is likely named for noted Soviet nuclear physicist and political dissident Andrei Sakharov, a key figure in the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons program who, later in life, specialized in cosmology.
In Mass Effect 2, when the player sends the first probe to the planet, EDI comments "Really, Commander?", and after the second launch, she sighs "Probing Uranus…" This is a reference to a schoolboy pun: "Uranus" bears a resemblance to the English phrase "your anus". This pun has been literally translated in non-English versions of Mass Effect 2, but the comical effect is, of course, lost. At subsequent probe launches, EDI reverts back to her standard feedback: "Launching probe." or "Probe away."
