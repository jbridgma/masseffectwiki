Dirada's inhospitable terrestrial worlds are particularly rich in resources. Siano, believed to be an extrasolar capture that caused the formation of one of the system's two asteroid belts, has millennia-old bunkers of radioactive waste built by unknown parties.
Its three giant planets don't have much in resources. Sineus' orbital stations are noteworthy for their superior radiation shielding. Vioresa's extremely long orbital period caused it to be missed in the initial asari survey of the system.
