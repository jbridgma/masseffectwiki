Description[]
Tremanre is a dwarf planet composed of light magnesium silicates, with deposits of aluminum. Its surface is covered by wide swathes of ancient, dark basaltic lava, possibly indicating the world was created through an impact with some other body in the system.
Tremanre's magnetic field is nonexistent. This makes it impossible for ships to dump their drive core charge from orbit. That said, Tremanre's minuscule gravity allows even cruiser-sized vessels to land safely for direct grounding.

Properties[]
Since this planet has no atmosphere and negligible albedo, the radiation it gets from its sun may be derived from its temperature and orbital period.
