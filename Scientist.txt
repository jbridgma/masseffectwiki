Mass Effect[]
Two ExoGeni Corporation scientists are holed up inside their own facility on Nodacrux due to their illegally-created Thorian Creepers going berserk and killing their fellow personnel. Should Commander Shepard discover their hiding place, one of them, Dr. Ross, explains their situation and attempts to bribe the Commander in exchange for their freedom. Accepting the bribe results in Shepard letting them go while refusing the bribe leads to a fight and their inevitable deaths.

Tactics[]
The Scientists have little health, no shields, and are only armed with a pistol, meaning they should go down with basically no effort. Their two Mercenary companions will prove to be marginally harder to kill. The Scientists will tend to stay in cover because of this and only pop out to take potshots at their opponents.
At the start of the fight, Dr. Ross always makes a beeline for the table barricade to her right (your left). There's a conveniently-placed destructible containment cell there that you can shoot to send her flying and greatly reduce her health (if not outright kill her).

Armament

Abilities

Health
Low


Shields
Low


Locations
Project Base


Following Commander Shepard's incapacitation at Project Base, one scientist monitors their sedation levels and discovers to her horror that the system isn't glitching: Shepard is fighting off the drugs and regaining consciousness. She manages to bolt out of the medical bay and call for security. While the Commander subdues the two armed guards there, the scientist uses the distraction to raise a barrier and trap Shepard in the medical bay. Unfortunately, the controls for the local supply of LOKI Mechs are on Shepard's side of the room, and the scientist ineffectually warns Shepard to step away from there. Shepard remote-controls as many LOKIs as needed and uses them to kill the scientist and disable the barrier.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
The scientist is armed with an M-3 Predator.

Defensive
The scientist has only health on lower difficulties and a light shielding on higher ones. 

Tactics[]
The scientist has no special behavioral patterns and should be easily shredded by the LOKI's M-4 Shuriken, shielded or not. She doesn't move around and will simply try to shoot the mech down from where she stands.
