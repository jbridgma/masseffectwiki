Mass Effect: Andromeda


Chief Engineer Grace Lito, designation E-97-Durango, used to work at both Site 1: Promise and Site 2: Resilience on Eos. When the first two Andromeda Initiative outposts failed, she bore the responsibility of shutting down the evacuation muster points and returned to cryostasis back on the Nexus.
Pathfinder Ryder can find datapads containing her logs or entries relating to her while exploring Eos. One of those datapads in Site 1 has her urging her colleagues to prioritize necessities instead of the Remnant monoliths. Another is a lead to a special project in Site 2. 
If the datapad containing her last entry is discovered, Ryder can request Vladimir Brecka on Operations to revive her. Grace returns to Eos, this time on the more successful settlement Prodromos. If interacted with, she's grateful to the Pathfinder for introducing hope again.
She can be found in the southern building of Prodromos, on the top floor.
If she's out of cryo by the time Liam Kosta tries fixing his screw-up with assist from Prodromos, she lends her hacking skills while Ryder and squad deal with the more tangible threats.
Grace labeled many of Eos' features and can be heard over comms on first visit to those areas explaining how and why.
