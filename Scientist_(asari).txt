The Scientist is an asari assistant to the krogan Doctor Droyas. She is assisting the doctor in providing Saren Arterius with a cure to the krogan genophage.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




During the assault on Saren's base on Virmire, Shepard and the squad run across her (titled "Scientist") in Droyas' upper-level genophage lab. When she notices Shepard, she wonders aloud concerning the whereabouts of the guards.

Tactics[]
Despite being an asari the scientist does not use any biotic attacks; instead she is armed with an assault rifle and a shotgun. She uses the shotgun at close range and switches to the rifle at long range, where she fires in very short accurate bursts.
For defense, she only has weak shielding and moderate health; however, uniquely for an asari opponent she can use Immunity on higher difficulties making her much tougher. She also wears heavy armor making it difficult to knock her down with melee attacks.
Don't prioritize taking her out in this fight, and instead focus on taking out Doctor Droyas, who can disable you with his abilities, and any husks first.
