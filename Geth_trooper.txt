This article is about the enemy encountered in the Mass Effect games. For the character in Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer mode, see Geth Trooper Soldier.

Geth Troopers are the standard ground forces of the geth throughout the Mass Effect Trilogy. On the battlefield, they usually attack in groups and are supported by stronger geth units.

Geth Troopers are standard geth infantry. These units are lightly equipped, with no exotic weapons, and are normally found in groups of two or more. They are dark grey in color, with pale green synthetic "flesh" and a bright blue 'flashlight eye'. They lack heavy armor, resulting in a weakness to weapons fire, and their low weight makes them vulnerable to biotics or grenades.

Tactics[]
These enemies possess neither the firepower of the Juggernauts nor the mobility of the Hoppers, but are versatile foes nonetheless. They are encountered in a wide variety of combat arenas, so caution must be taken to account for the many differing settings where they may be fought.
Their shields recover after several seconds or when they use shield boost. They're also unique in having a geth hex shield: a blue (shading to orange when damaged) 3m hexagon that completely obscures the geth and will absorb all damage until it is destroyed. The Geth Troopers will use this ability when their health is low, forsaking cover while it's active.
Tech talents such as Sabotage or Overload to lower their shields or overheat their weapons will make them vulnerable targets. Since their health doesn't regenerate, these abilities also act as good damage dealers.
AI Hacking of any strength will make them temporarily assist you. While useful at low level, upgraded hacking shouldn't be wasted on them if targets like Geth Destroyers, Geth Shock Troopers or (when fully upgraded) Geth Primes are available.
Armor Piercing Rounds are recommended against these foes, due to their anti-synthetic bonus.
Biotic powers such as Lift and Singularity will lift geth into the air, making them incapable of combat and easy targets.

In Mass Effect 2, Geth Troopers are the most common type of geth encountered. They differ in color from previous encounters, being white instead of steel gray, thus bearing more resemblance to Geth Shock Troopers from the previous game.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
They are equipped with the standard Geth Pulse Rifle.
Defensive
Troopers possess the Geth Shield Boost ability, which can replenish their shields back to full strength when low or depleted. Like other enemies, they will take additional damage from headshots.

Tactics[]
Geth Troopers tend to be quite weak, but usually come in significant numbers. They are also usually supported by more powerful units, such as Geth Hunters.
Disruptor Ammo, Overload, Energy Drain, Shield Penetration Upgrades and weapons which deal good shield damage already are the best methods of dealing with their shielding and most will also do good damage to their health as well.
Geth are known for their strong shielding, even though Troopers don't actually have stronger base shields than other basic enemies in Mass Effect 2—the extra strength comes from their Shield Boost ability, forcing you to have to plow through a second bar of shielding before they can be killed. Therefore, it's a good idea to disable or kill them before they have a chance to activate this power to recharge their shields. Flashbang Grenade can suppress their ability to use their shield restore for a good amount of time.
It's totally acceptable to use AI Hacking on Troopers, especially if the power is maxed out to either hack multiple Troopers at once or to give a single trooper a large shield. A hacked Trooper can serve as a distraction for quite a long time, tying up hordes of other geth long enough for you and your squad to take them out.



Mass Effect 3[]







Geth Trooper




Faction
Geth


Type
Synthetic


Armament
Geth Pulse Rifle


Abilities
None


Health
Moderate


Locations
Geth Dreadnought, Rannoch


Geth Troopers return as enemies in Mass Effect 3. They are once again colored steel gray with green "skin", now with white armor markings.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Geth Troopers are armed with a Geth Pulse Rifle and can melee at anyone who gets too close to them.
Defensive
Geth Troopers have no shields or armor, but can evade attacks by quickly jumping to the side. Like other humanoid enemies, they take 40% additional damage from headshots and can be staggered by gunfire or powers.

Tactics[]
Most sniper rifles can immediately kill Geth Troopers with a headshot.
Geth Troopers can easily swarm reckless players. Other geth units will often try to flush the player from cover, providing troopers with an opportunity to cut them down with their rapid-firing Geth Pulse Rifles.
Because they are both weaker enemies than most and capable of inflicting moderate to severe damage in numbers, Geth Troopers also act as distractions to give more powerful geth units a chance to close in. When focusing on a group of Troopers, watch out for cloaked Geth Hunters and Geth Pyros either moving with the group or approaching from other directions.
Weapons that deal area of effect damage, or powers that deal with them outright are very useful here. An Overload focused on damage can sometimes deal with Troopers in just one go, while Energy Drain is most effective against clusters with the rank 4 evolution "Radius" is acquired, potentially providing full restoration of shields, and/or a 40% boost to damage protection for 10 seconds. Finally, grenades are very effective at eliminating clusters of troopers, especially the Cluster Grenades as they split up and can cause massive damage over a very wide area.
If, in multiplayer, your team is occupying an area (for example, for some of the objectives) on earlier waves and there are not enough of you to cover all approaches, it can be very useful to lay Proximity Mines on one area - when evolved correctly, they can eliminate entire squads before they can flank you.
They are less likely to dodge attacks if staggered by gunfire, if you are in close proximity, or if they are focused on another target.

Mass Effect: Infiltrator[]







Geth Trooper




Type
Geth


Armament
M-96 Mattock Auto


Abilities
None


Health
Low


Shields
Low


Locations
Ice Giant, Comm Relay, Access Corridor



Geth Troopers are basic geth infantry units armed with M-96 Mattock Auto assault rifles. Randall Ezno fights them during his first mission and again later on the Barn space station after the geth invade in search of the target Ezno beat them to.

Tactics[]
Geth Troopers are the first enemies encountered in the game and as such quite fragile, possessing low health and a weak layer of shielding. Their shielding will regenerate over time.
Geth Troopers frequently take cover during combat and tend not to come out unless you're in their line of fire. This allows you to wait out behind cover for your powers to recharge without being disturbed. Using Pull will flush the Troopers from cover into the open.
Like all humanoid enemies in the game, Geth Troopers are vulnerable to headshots, which will inflict bonus damage to them.
