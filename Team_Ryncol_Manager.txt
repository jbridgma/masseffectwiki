Appearances
Mass Effect: Andromeda


The Team Ryncol Manager is one of the two ticket hawkers for New Tuchanka's Wraith fighting pit.
Like his counterpart the Blood Threshers Manager, he only sells a blue ticket for 10 credits (base price). If the preferred animal wins, the blue ticket transforms into a gold winning ticket which can be sold only to either merchant for 30 credits (base price). 
Additionally, he can pay full price for all nonsalvage items. For salvage items, he buys them at five times the usual rate, making him and his counterpart the best merchants to sell items to in the entire Heleus Cluster.
