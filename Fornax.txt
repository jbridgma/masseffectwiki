Trivia[]
Fornax is Latin for 'furnace' and seems an adequate name, given the nature of the magazine.
The name Fornax may also be a play on the word "fornication", meaning sexual intercourse, especially between unmarried individuals.
Fornax (originally called Fornax Chemica, lat. for chemical furnace) is the name of a star constellation.
Grunt, according to his Shadow Broker files, has purchased a Special Krogan edition of Fornax.
