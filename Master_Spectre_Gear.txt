Spectre - Master Gear items are prototype equipment not available through regular vendors, and are essentially the ultimate weapons of Mass Effect, standing head and shoulders above anything else in the entire game. Only two merchants in the game sell this gear, the Alliance Requisition Officer aboard the SSV Normandy and the Requisition Officer in the C-Sec Academy.
If you have completed Admiral Ahern's wager on Pinnacle Station, Spectre gear (between tier VII or X) is also randomly given out at your apartment at your PC there (for 220,000 credits).
To gain access to VII-level Spectre - Master Gear from the Alliance Requisition Officer or the C-Sec Requisition Officer, you must first unlock the "Rich" achievement by amassing one million credits. To gain the X-level gear, you need to unlock "Rich" Achievement, and be level fifty. The VII-level gear is available to all new careers once unlocked, but each character has to be level fifty in order to unlock X-level. 
Legendary Edition:  Level X Spectre - Master Gear can first be acquired after reaching the Citadel Lockdown portion of the story after all four main story worlds are complete.

Appearance[]
The name of each Spectre - Master Gear weapon (eight total, with one level VII and one level X of each of the four weapon types) begins with "HMW" and is immediately followed by one or two letters denoting its weapon type — A for assault rifles, P for pistols, SG for shotguns, and SR for sniper rifles.
All of the Spectre - Master Gear range share a similar visual appearance, a complete matte black color that is unique compared to other manufacturers.
On each weapon in the Spectre - Master Gear range, there is a strip of slanted lines which emit a light in each slit. These lights change color depending on whether the gun is holstered or not, which can be clearly seen if the weapon is equipped by a squad member. The location of the strip of lights varies between each weapon: it can be found on the stock of the weapon, or at the barrel.

Weapons[]
All Spectre weapons incorporate adaptive fire control technology, making them the most powerful and accurate weapons available.[1]
From the weapons listing below, only the VII and X sophistication levels of the Spectre - Master gear items can be found in-game; the rest can be acquired through console commands in the PC version.

Trivia[]
Visually, the emblem for the Master Gear (the arch with three stars within it) is very similar to the emblem of the Systems Alliance, which is the same arch with a silhouette of Earth in it.
References[]

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 50: Spectre's Adaptive Fire Control gives +60% to Damge, +9% to Heat Absorption and +70% to Accuracy. When compared to baseline stats, the calculations for Damage appear control but not the other two, despite clear increases being visible.
