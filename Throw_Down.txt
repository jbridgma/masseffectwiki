Throw Down was a mining station on the moon Caleston during the development of Mass Effect, before the planet was renamed to Therum and everything preceding the journey to the Prothean ruins was cut. It was to serve as the main hub for meeting characters and doing side-quests on the planet, similar to Port Hanshan on Noveria and Zhu's Hope on Feros.

Government[]
The station belongs to the Eldfell-Ashland Energy corporation, which has appointed Nonya Tombiri as administrator of Throw Down. However, the real power is split between two rivaling factions, the Cartel, a drug smuggling operation headed by the salarian brothers Smiley and Raciloma, and the Miners' Union, a criminal ring whose secret leader is revealed to be Tombiri herself.

Facilities[]

At the center of Throw Down is the plaza, from which most facilities can be accessed. Below, the ship hangar and the nearby garage are supervised by Charlie Booker, the harbormaster.[1] The hanar Oronath owns a modest infirmary on the plaza, as Eldfell-Ashland sold the original medical building to serve as Smiley's residence.[2] Administrator Tombiri's office is on the second floor of the plaza.[3] Ruushok's bar, The Seventh Moon, is also found on the plaza.
An elevator allows the workers to get down to the refinery, or anyone who has the required code to activate it.[4]
