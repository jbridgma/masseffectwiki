Player Notes[]
In multiplayer, Collector and Prothean weapon damage bonus stacks multiplicatively with the normal ones. It applies only to the Particle Rifle, Collector Assault Rifle, Collector SMG, and Collector Sniper Rifle. It will also improve the damage of ammo equipment used on those weapons.
If all power damage evolutions are taken, Vengeful Ancient provides the highest power damage bonus of any multiplayer class passive power.
Javik's Rank 6 Squad Bonus evolutions apply to all members of the party including Javik himself. There is possibility for confusion, as similarly named "Squad Bonus" evolutions on Shepard's various class powers do not apply to Shepard, only to NPC squadmates.
Javik's Rank 6 Squad Bonus evolution that buffs party power damage, force, and duration applies to all power types including tech, biotic, and powers that are neither tech or biotic (i.e. "combat" powers such as Concussive Shot and Frag Grenade). This is in contrast to the Rank 6 Squad Bonus evolution of Garrus's Turian Rebel passive that only applies to specifically "combat" powers and not tech or biotics.
Javik's shield-recharge Squad Bonus can stack with the similar evolution of Kaidan's Alliance Officer class power.
