Firebase Aqua is a map in Mass Effect: Andromeda's multiplayer mode.
Description[]
The angara—and their Resistance—have long relied on this once-hidden clean water source for survival. Now that their water-processing plant's location is no longer a secret, we need to make any invaders think twice about attempting to occupy it.
