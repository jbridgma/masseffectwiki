Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Lift Grenades inflict 1.5x damage to biotic barriers and full damage to all other types of protection. It deals considerably more damage in multiplayer.
Grenade powers do not have a recharge time and can be used immediately at any time, provided grenades are available. Using the power consumes one grenade each time.
If the player has multiple grenade powers, the grenade pool is shared between them.
Lift Grenades do an admirable amount of damage, but also make weak unprotected enemies (red bar) who are not killed outright float helplessly in the air, much like how Pull works. The blast also penetrates cover and terrain.
The lifting effect can work on Cerberus Guardians even with their riot shields up if the grenade detonation occurs behind their shields or directly on a gap in the shield. Against CAT6 Heavies, Lift Grenade will damage them if it gets past their omni-shield in the same way (as will any grenade power), but the lift effect does nothing.
The lifting effect of Lift Grenade can be detonated by other biotic powers.
Lift Grenade detonates all four types of Power Combos but only if the target is unprotected (red health bar). For example, a Cerberus Centurion hit by Overload completely losing its shields that is then hit by Lift Grenade will cause a Tech Burst in addition to the lift effect/damage of the grenade, but if the Overload did not completely remove its shield, there will be no Tech Burst from the grenade hit. The same would apply to Warp and triggering a Biotic Explosion.
The radius can be upgraded to 8 meters, making Lift Grenade one of the larger grenade blasts in the game.
Thrown Lift Grenades immediately explode if they make a direct hit on an enemy.
Strategies
Lift Grenade can be used to not only kill enemies, but to disrupt tightly clustered weaker enemies, or stubborn enemies behind cover. It can also separate smaller enemies hiding behind or sticking to a heavy enemy (Atlas, Geth Prime, etc.).
In single-player, Lift Grenade is highly effective against enemy positions fortified by Cerberus shield generators and pylons or Reaper Barrier Engines, especially when evolved for maximum blast radius.
