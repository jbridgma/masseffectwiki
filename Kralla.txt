Description[]
After half the crew of a survey ship died in a freak accident, the ship's captain named this desert planet Kralla, after an ancient asari demon of misfortune.
Kralla is said to delight in thwarting carefully laid plans at the last moment, tipping apparent success toward utter disaster. Legend says she only targets those whose plans are long in the making, an obvious warning against hubris for a race whose plans tend to stretch over centuries.

Trivia[]
The Kralla's Song bar in the Andromeda galaxy appears to be another namesake of the demon this planet is named for.
