Description[]
During the initial survey of the Antaeus system, only a single fly-by probe was spared for the small, scorched world of Ageko. It revealed a planet unusually rich in heavier elements, given its size.
Ageko is a standard terrestrial with a thin atmosphere of krypton and xenon. Its crust is mainly composed of magnesium with deposits of cobalt and other heavy metals. Due to extremely rough, cratered terrain, starships are discouraged from landing.

Trivia[]
In the PC version, the system is erroneously spelled Anataeus in its description.
