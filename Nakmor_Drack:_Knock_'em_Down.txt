To: Ryder
From: Drack 

Hey kid, 

Now that we've got the transport back, maybe let's take a load off.

Swing by Kralla's Song next time we're in Kadara Port. The bartender's getting to be a friend of mine. She'll mix you up something that'll strip paint.

Meet Drack at Kralla's Song[]
Head to Kralla's Song in Kadara Port on Kadara.
Ryder will begin by noticing a human slumped on the floor. Drack explains that one of his friends wanted the human to challenge Drack to a headbutting contest. 
A pirate will then bump into the Pathfinder roughly and want to start a fight.
A brawl then ensues. Afterward, Ryder and Drack deliberate over a drink on keeping this a secret from Nakmor Kesh. You can choose either way but there are no consequences.

Aftermath[]
When you return to the Tempest Nakmor Drack: How to Act Tough starts.

Rewards[]
None
