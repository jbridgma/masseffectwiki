Mass Effect: Andromeda



Nesi Cartar is an asari colonist for the Andromeda Initiative. She is a former member of the Mining Company 07 that mined Element Zero on Mars. Nesi thinks that the Mining Company is like a family for her. She joined the Initiative because she couldn't let them go on such an adventure in Andromeda without her.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




If Pathfinder Ryder manages to settle Kadara, she becomes the science officer of the Andromeda Initiative's Outpost Ditaeon on the planet Kadara. She works in the outpost alongside her former colleague from Be the Mining Company 07. Their role is to collect the sulfur located in Kadara's bedrock to produce fertilizer for the Initiative.
