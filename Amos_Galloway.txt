Amos Galloway is a former smuggler who rejoined the Andromeda Initiative after siding with the rebels in the Nexus Uprising. However, he was kidnapped by his ex-boss Meriweather in order to draw out the person who apparently helped him escape her: Vetra Nyx.

Background[]
When the Nexus first arrived in Andromeda under disastrous conditions, Galloway scapegoated the Initiative for their shortcomings, sided with the revolt when it happened, and accepted exile when his faction lost. However, he soon discovered that things weren't better in Kadara, or even when striking out alone and independently. 
Galloway and some other people started working for Meriweather, pitching in a lot of effort into their underground base in Crater: Idriya on H-047c. Initially they had no issues, but then their boss started doing things reprehensible to their sensibilities. Meriweather wouldn't simply let them go, so they needed someone to help them hide. Vetra apparently learned about their plight, and over comms, invented work assignments for Galloway and his group in Prodromos. 
Galloway is grateful for second chances and the fact he was able to see his family again. However, Meriweather managed to discover where Galloway and the others were hiding and had them abducted and imprisoned back into their base on H-047c.

Mass Effect: Andromeda[]
Galloway meets Vetra and Pathfinder Ryder when the latter fall into Meriweather's trap in H-047c. He assumes Vetra is only covering for his group when he overhears her denying knowledge of conflict with Meriweather. However, it soon comes to light that Galloway and his group were actually aided by Sidera Nyx, Vetra's sister, using Vetra's connections.
