Description[]
Kailo's frigid surface is dotted with impact craters left during a legendary meteor shower that happened more than 400,000 years ago. The meteors contained traces of cobalt, but not enough to warrant a full-scale mining expedition. The volus have largely left Kailo alone, as have the Reapers.
