Description[]
Telluune is named after the first elcor settlement in recorded history. The planet's name roughly translates to "the deep and restful meadowland," which is somewhat of a misnomer, given that Telluune's thick, crushing atmosphere keeps its surface boiling hot, and the air is a noxious mixture of carbon dioxide and helium.
