An Earth-based electronics concern, Ariake Tech is best known for their high grade omni-tools. Recently they have branched out to develop a line of high grade armor with an enhanced ablative weave to provide extra protection. Ariake Technologies manufactures Mercenary Armor for humans, krogan, and turians.
An armory license for Ariake Technologies can be purchased from either the C-Sec Requisitions Officer or from Commander Rentola, after being rescued from Virmire, aboard the SSV Normandy for 6,250 credits.
Ariake Technology also develops telemetry data-cleaning algorithms, for which Samantha Traynor and EDI purchase licenses during a conversation with Shepard after Priority: Sur'Kesh.

Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3[]
Ariake Technologies is the manufacturer for two shotguns:

M-23 Katana ShotgunCommon military shotgun. Deadly at short range, but ineffective at long range. Very effective versus shields and biotic barriers, but weak versus armor. Manufactured by Ariake Technologies, the Katana is a common mercenary weapon, and is also popular on colonies with Varren infestations.
M-27 Scimitar Assault ShotgunAn elite military shotgun capable of rapid fire, this weapon is deadly at short range, but ineffective at long range. Effective against shields and biotic barriers, but weak against armor. Manufactured by Ariake Technologies.
Armor[]
Mass Effect[]
Ariake Tech's ablative weave grants its armors a boost in shields at the cost of diminished tech/biotic damage protection.[2]

Trivia[]
The Official Game Guide lists other lines of armor and weapons which didn't appear in the game: Ikazuchi sniper rifle, Kaji shotgun, and the Ronin armor.
Kuwashii means "accurate" in Japanese.
A naginata is a polearm that was used in feudal-era Japan.
Ariake's name is of Japanese origin, written as 有明 and translating poetically as "Dawn, But Still the Moon Remains in the Sky." This is echoed in their company logo, which is notably missing the moon detail.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 46: Ariake Technologies' Radiation Synch gives +20% to Damage, +4% to Heat Absorption and +18% to Accuracy in comparison to baseline stats. The calculations for Damage appear correct, but the other two's don't match exactly, despite increases being noticeable.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 46: Ariake Technologies' Ablative Weave gives +30% to Shields and -10% to Hardening in comparison to baseline stats. While the former's calculations are correct, the latter's don't match despite a clear reduction being observable.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 46: Ariake Technologies' Adaptive Overlay gives +10 in Shields (mistakenly shown in the Armor column as +10%), -10 in Tech Cooldown Time (mistakenly shown as -10%) and +10 in Medical (mistakenly shown as +10%). When compared to baseline stats, all calculations appear correct.
