Prerequisite: Task: Getting to Know the Nexus

Speak with Chief Lucan on the Nexus (after speaking to Professor Herik in the aforementioned mission) and accept his request for help hitting rocks for science.
Warning: Declining to participate will lock this task out even after unlocking the scientists' Tech Lab on the Nexus, after the Eos vault's activation. It is highly advisable to accept the task when it is given.

Walkthrough[]
Access the Terminal[]
After agreeing to help Chief Lucan, access the nearby terminal to review the patch notes on the Geophysics VI that he's been building.
