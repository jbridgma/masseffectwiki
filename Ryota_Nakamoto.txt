Dr. Ryota Nakamoto is a physician formerly of the Andromeda Initiative. He runs a free clinic in the Kadara Slums.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Background[]
Dr. Nakamoto joined the Initiative out of a desire to save lives. He did not actually participate in the Nexus Uprising, he simply followed his patients into exile figuring they could use someone like him. 
On Kadara Dr. Nakamoto discovered a strain of bacteria with properties similar to penicillin. Upon learning of its addictive side effects, however, Sloane Kelly turned his research into producing the drug Oblivion.
Already disillusioned with the Outcasts' violent and ruthless antics, in response Dr. Nakamoto quit his relatively secure position and moved his practice into the slums. To support his clinic he has been getting anonymous donations he suspects came from the Charlatan. He viewed this benefactor with equal contempt as Sloane, thinking they ultimately cared more about profits than the people. The majority of his patients either suffered from gunshot wounds or water poisoning.

Mass Effect: Andromeda[]
Pathfinder Ryder can first encounter Dr. Nakamoto treating a trio of patients out of a shipping container. He requests for help in stealing back the drug formula for Oblivion from his old lab out on Haarfel.
If Ryder returns the formula to Dr. Nakamoto, he will be very pleased and moves his clinic and patients to the Ditaeon outpost as soon as it is established. 
If Ryder decides to let Arenna Farenth keep the drug formula, Dr. Nakamoto becomes bitter with Ryder and doesn't leave the Kadara Slums.
