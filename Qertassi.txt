Qertassi is utterly unremarkable in all respects except for the size of its star and the presence of SSV Trafalgar in 2186. Its sole ice giant has moderate resources.

Trivia[]
Qertassi used to be a sandstone quarry in ancient Egypt, now submerged under Lake Nasser in Lower Nubia. The place later lends its name to the Kiosk of Qertassi, an ancient Roman monument, and possibly this system.
