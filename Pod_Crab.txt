Pod Crabs are a mostly benign species of non-sentient creatures native to the planet Virmire. These massive crustacean-like creatures walk on four sturdy legs, each ending in hard points. They feed on large mollusk-like creatures found in Virmire's waters.
Pod crabs are not very resilient, and can be killed in one shot or simply by driving the Mako over them; they leave no remains and explode to pulp. The crabs seem to be unaware of danger, and do not appear to notice if one of their kindred is shot down.
