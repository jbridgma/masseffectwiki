Description[]
Juntauma is a small, broiling terrestrial world. Its thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide and ethane is being steadily "blown off" by the powerful solar wind from the star Farinata. The surface is scorching hot, and mainly composed of sulphur with deposits of copper. Its density is low enough to leave the world tidally locked to Farinata.
The Alliance Defense Data Network notes that several ships have been spotted cruising near Juntauma with transponders turned off. While an Alliance patrol attempted pursuit of one, the unidentified vessel "rabbited" to FTL. Its trail was lost when it obscured its light trace in the confusion of signals along the Anansi-Ishtar shipping lane.

Survey Text[]

“Scans of Juntauma revealed a derelict freighter in mid-stage orbital decay. Your salvage team boarded the vessel and determined it had been attacked by raiders. There was little of value still on board, but the team did find a Prothean data disc.”
