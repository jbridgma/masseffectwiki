What better place to look for burn treatment plans than a fuel reactor out in asari spaceAs always, all roads lead to the Citadel1/2
A doctor is looking for a way to treat a patient with chemical burns. Find a treatment plan and deliver it to the Huerta Memorial Hospital.
Alternative journal entry:
A treatment plan for chemical burns has been recovered from a reactor on Cyone. Find someone on the Citadel who can use this information.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II

Prerequisite: N7: Fuel Reactors

At Lab Services in Huerta Memorial (left side on the map) there's a human and a salarian doctor (Dr. Silon) discussing a patient who was injured by some chemical agent deployed by Cerberus during their attack on the Citadel. Simply overhearing their conversation activates the mission.
Alternatively, the mission objective and the mission itself can be acquired directly while restarting a fuel reactor on Cyone.

Walkthrough[]

This is another item retrieval mission within a mission. Its parent mission only becomes available after Priority: Geth Dreadnought. Head up to the left area at the start, on a datapad that overlooks the radiation below you.
The plans can also be purchased from the Spectre Requisitions terminal for 1,000 credits if you did not take it during the main mission.
Return to Huerta Memorial and hand over the treatment plans to Dr. Silon to complete the mission. He claims it's experimental but he's willing to try if it'll work. 
Completion gives you 5 reputation, 30 experience and 1,000 credits. It also updates the Alliance First Fleet War Asset.
