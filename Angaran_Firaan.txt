Description[]
With few resources, the angara are fighting a guerilla war. Over many years they have developed concealable, deadly, and nearly unbreakable weapons - including the Firaan, an improvement on Milky Way monomolecular blade technology. This small knife can slice through well-armored foes and sharpens itself whenever re-sheathed.

Features[]
The Angaran Firaan is a mid-tier melee weapon that boasts a high attack speed but no special abilities. 
The Firaan appears to have an exceptionally low chance to drop as random loot despite its mere Uncommon rating.

Strategies[]
With no useful abilities to its name, the Firaan is overshadowed by any melee weapon that deals more damage. The Heleus Research Points required to unlock its construction should be invested in kett melee weapons instead, and any looted examples should be recycled for resources unless the situation is really dire.

Trivia[]
The Firaan's item description implies a damage bonus to armored enemies, but if this feature was implemented in gameplay, it does not appear to work properly.
