“Salvation comes with a cost.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Ascension follow.




Cuervo is the nearest Alliance colony to the Migrant Fleet shortly after Cerberus' attempt at reclaiming their biotic asset Gillian Grayson from the flotilla in 2183. Kahlee Sanders and the quarian Lemm'Shal vas Idenna intend to drop off former Cerberus agent Paul Grayson to the authorities on Cuervo and have him taken into custody, but are overwhelmed when Grayson grabs Kahlee's stunner gun and knocks them both out. Once they come to, Grayson is gone and their shuttle is instead docked with the spaceport of Daleon, a volus colony.
