Svanha is a vendor on Techiix. Unlike most merchants that can be encountered by Pathfinder Ryder, she sells nothing of interest to them.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Background[]
Svanha was born on Aya and spent her childhood there. Even after moving to Voeld she never forgot her experiences there. However, she had no inclination to return since her family and livelihood are now on the frozen world.

Having heard of the first human visitor to Aya, the first time Svanha meets Ryder she asks if her birth world is still as beautiful as she remembers. She regrets Ryder not seeing more if the Pathfinder tells her they were mostly confined to the Docks. Otherwise, she confesses to missing the place terribly.
Svanha sells what she defines as "small comforts": anything handheld that might remind angara of happier times while huddling in the dark. Her customers are mostly refugees who grabbed what they can while fleeing from the kett, so she pays them handsomely should they offload their stuff to her in preparation for a lighter journey elsewhere.
