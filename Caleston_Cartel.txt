The Caleston Cartel, often simply called Cartel, was a drug-dealing criminal syndicate that operated on Caleston during the development of Mass Effect. It was led by two salarian brothers, Sannul "Smiley" Amnoss and Raciloma Amnoss.
The Cartel is said to have "defied the authorities for years." They arrived on Caleston six months before the events of Mass Effect, and since then, they've been battling for control of Throw Down station, or more accurately its element zero refinery, with the Miners' Union. While the latter is in charge of the heavy machinery and the refinery workers, the Cartel is said to be in control of the refining labs. They use those labs to manufacture red sand, which they then ship to Earth for selling. Most of the members of the Cartel appear to be alien, prominently turians.[1]
Liara T'Soni reportedly made a deal with the Cartel to have Prothean artefacts moved off-world, which is, as Administrator Tombiri claims, how she was captured by Smiley's men. That however was a lie meant to make Shepard destroy the Cartel, which happens whatever Shepard decides to do with Smiley. A news report later mentions that Eldfell-Ashland Energy, who owns the Throw Down refinery, is pleased that they've stopped operating in their station. If Tombiri was killed or arrested, the report mentions her disappearance must have been related to her links to the Cartel.[2]
