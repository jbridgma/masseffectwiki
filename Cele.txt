Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Hunting the Archon

The mission is acquired if after talking to Jim in The Docks' observation deck jail, but only if you agreed to deliver the message. You can talk to him again if you declined the first time and you've changed your mind.
Warning:  This mission is only available as long as Sloane Kelly is the boss of Kadara Port  AND the mission High Noon hasn't been completed. If the Charlatan becomes the new boss during High Noon, Jim will not be in the cell, and the mission is unavailable.

Walkthrough[]
This is a simple "run around and talk to people" mission, easily finished since it only requires walking between two adjacent areas and choosing how to continue conversations.

Jim is locked up in jail since he drunkenly pissed on a turian Outcast guard's boots. He begs Ryder to pass along a message to Cele down in Tartarus that he'll have the credits to pay Sloane's protection fees soon, and that she should wait for him (while omitting the part that he's in jail).
Speak to Cele at Tartarus[]
Cele is in one of the dancer cages in the bar's upper floor doing her job, who denies being Jim's girlfriend. Turns out Jim's just delusional, probably evidenced by his gushing descriptions of Cele when you talked to him. Cele doesn't need Jim's money since she's perfectly happy where she is, and she doesn't need "rescuing" from a "pup" like him.
You can deliver her answer to Jim, or tell Cele to do it herself. Whatever you choose is immaterial since you'll have some words with Jim anyway.

Return  to Jim[]
When you talk to him again, you can either call out his delusion or pass Cele's message along in a more diplomatic way. In either case you'll tell him to focus on himself first.

Reward[]
+270 XP
