This article is about the class specialization in the first game. For the class power evolution in Mass Effect 2, see Biotic Mastery. For the Cerberus unit in Mass Effect 3, see Nemesis (enemy).


Nemesis is an unlockable specialization class for the Adept and Vanguard, with the alternate specialization options being the Bastion and the Shock Trooper, respectively. A biotic who uses their abilities to damage and weaken their foes, the Nemesis gains bonus damage to all biotic talents, and is granted improved versions of Lift and Warp.
