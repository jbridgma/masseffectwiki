The Repository of History serves as a museum for ancient artifacts. Through collection and study of such artifacts, its curators aim to help their people remember in light of the angara forgetting much of their past due to the Scourge and the kett invasion decimating angaran civilization.

The museum can be reached through two doors to its north and south in Aya's capital city. To the east lies the Resistance Headquarters while to the northwest is The Tavetaan. Inside, the only door that isn't an exit leads to Moshae Sjefa's Laboratory.
The repository's walls are lined with angara, kett, and Remnant artifacts, many of them dating from before the Scourge. Small artifacts float within their display pedestals, while larger collections are displayed as is.
Head curator Avela Kjar oversees the exhibits, and her two assistants Nalon and Elihn wander around inspecting each one. Peebee usually hangs around here during Aya visits, where she often observes the Remnant exhibits. A datapad containing correspondence between Avela and her mother can be found near her, though it disappears later.
With the opening of the Andromeda Initiative Embassy nearby, a section of the repository is later made available for cultural artifacts brought by the Andromeda Initiative from the Milky Way: a human anthropologist and a salarian historian hastily assembled a number of items for display. Several items found during exploration of the Heleus Cluster can also make their way into the exhibits.

Artifact

Description




Ancient Pottery
Translated from Shelesh:
This pottery fragment is believed to be a ceremonial decoration from the ancient temples of Havarl.





Angaran Dagger
Translated from Shelesh:
This dagger dates back four centuries, to the time just after the Scourge appeared. Faced with a technological dark age, our ancient ancestors learned to fight and hunt without the use of advanced weaponry.





Angaran Exhibit
Translated from Shelesh:
Though we know little about our pre-Scourge ancestors, evidence points to a grand, multi-planet society with sophisticated technology. Many recent discoveries indicate our ancestors even traveled vast distances between systems. Though we have no way of knowing for sure, most scholars theorize our people's early success was due to the use of Remnant technology.





Excavation from Havarl
Translated from Shelesh:
Archaeologists on Havarl recently discovered what they believe are pieces from the oldest structure as yet found on the planet. These fragments were literally uprooted by mutating vegetation rising from an underground cavern. Though the exact cultural nature of this find remains unknown, teams of researchers have recently established a permanent dig site to search for more clues.





Kett Exaltation Tool
Translated from Shelesh:
Until recently, we knew this was a kett tool, but didn't understand its purpose. Scholars have recently determined it's used in the exaltation of our people. Though it may be difficult to look at, it's important we learn and understand exaltation, to protect ourselves and our loved ones.





Kett Exhibit
Translated from Shelesh:
First contact with the kett varied among our homeworlds. While the kett sought to confuse Havarl with silence, they murdered the ambassador on Voeld. They turned our worlds against each other, and took advantage of the confusion and chaos. It's important for us all to learn from this moment in history, and to present a united front in the face of adversity.





Remnant Device
Translated from Shelesh:
While we can't know for certain, theories about this Remnant device suggest its function may be to convert rock and sand into nutrient-rich soil.





Remnant Exhibit
Translated from Shelesh:
Though we don't know much about the Remnant or its creators, we've determined the Remnant were present in Heleus long before our people. The Remnant's purpose appears to be the same as the planetary vaults: to transform a world into a thriving, beautiful paradise. Before the arrival of Pathfinder Ryder in Revolution 826, modern attempts to interact with the Remnant had been unsuccessful, but we've been able to coexist with them peacefully on Aya.





Ruins from Daar Kulmaal
Translated from Shelesh:
This fragment is from a wall of the governor's public residence on Voeld, which was destroyed by kett bombardment during the initial invasion. The governor, all staff, and most of her immediate family were all killed in the blast. When Voeld stands liberated, this relic will form the cornerstone of a monument to those who gave their lives defending our home.

Angaran Figure
Translated from Shelesh:
While this carved figure pre-dates every artifact we've discovered, carbon dating indicates it's still only a millennium old. Its depiction may be an early deity whose identity was lost in the Scourge.


Forgotten History
Ja Niihk Dig Site, Voeld





Angaran Space Helmet
Translated from Shelesh:
In the time before the Scourge, angaran pilots wore helmets while covering the vast distances between planets. It's speculated that Remnant technology was used in this helmet's construction, attracting the Scourge's attention.


Recovering the Past
Chasm of the Builders, Havarl





Holo of the Tempest
Translated from Shelesh:
In Day 45 of Revolution 826, the ship known as the Tempest landed on Aya, and our people made first contact with sentient life from another galaxy, a human called Pathfinder Ryder.


Available upon opening of Andromeda Initiative Embassy




Milky Way System Exhibit
Translated from Shelesh:
Located millions of light years across dark space, the Milky Way galaxy is the origin of our newest Heleus residents. Though smaller and darker than Andromeda, the Milky Way is home not only to the species we've met, but also to countless sentient lifeforms. From the graceful hanar to the powerful elcor, dozens of unique species exist, making the Milky Way a cultural and social melting pot.


Available upon opening of Andromeda Initiative Embassy




Rivaan
Translated from Shelesh:
This pre-Scourge instrument may look different to you than the rivaans we use today. Though it no longer works with our bioelectric energy, the scrollwork and delicate flutes indicate it may have been able to produce a much greater range of sound than the modern rivaan.


Forgotten History
Kurinth's Valley, Kadara





Star Map
Translated from Shelesh:
Before the Scourge, angaran pilots kept visual logs of their routes and discoveries. While most were destroyed in the dark age, this star map displays limited data on several star systems.

Checking in
Translated from Shelesh:

Mother,

You wouldn't believe all that's happened since Pathfinder Ryder landed on Aya. I'm sure you know about the Moshae's rescue, but I suspect you've only heard the official version. Evfra and his Resistance like to claim credit for bringing her home, but I know for a fact they never could've accomplished it without the Pathfinder. People fear these new aliens will turn out to be like the kett. Don't listen to them. I feel in my spirit they've come to help, and you know I'm always right about these things.

I wish you could see some of the interesting relics we've found on Havarl and elsewhere. I'll bring images next time I visit. Also, I'm not seeing Aatu anymore. It was nothing particular that ended things. We're just too different. Don't worry—my work still brings me all the happiness I need.

- Avela
