An Alliance soldier knows the location of Prothean drives that could help with the Crucible project. Recover them from Garvug in the Valhallan Threshold and bring them to him at the Citadel docking bay.
Alternative journal entry:
Prothean data drives were recovered from the Valhallan Threshold. Find someone on the Citadel who can use them.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II

Overhear a soldier talking to his superior about the Crucible. He can be found right next to the door to the Normandy at Normandy Dock: Bay D24. He is only present after the Cerberus attack on the Citadel.
Alternatively, a Search and Rescue operation in the Valhallan Threshold  will yield the data drives and this mission's journal entry. In this case it is labeled Citadel: Prothean Data Drives. 

Walkthrough[]

As is standard in Search and Rescue missions, simply scan Garvug in Paz to get the artifact. Return it to the soldier when you get back to the Citadel.
Completion of the mission yields 5 Reputation, 15,000 credits, and an update to the War Asset Alliance Engineering Corps.

Trivia[]
As with Citadel: Reaper Code Fragments, it is difficult to not overhear the Soldier and obtain this mission on the Citadel, as he has a wide speaking radius that covers the only hallway back to the Normandy. However, the means to bypass him are more numerous: by save/reloading then heading straight for the door, by rushing past him, or by doing a Mass Effect 3: Leviathan mission which deposits Shepard straight to the Normandy upon completion.
