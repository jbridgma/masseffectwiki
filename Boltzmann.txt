Boltzmann's proximity to the Citadel make it a strategic place for expanding humanity's economic reach. Three major firms compete for abundant resources that are exclusively earmarked for Bekenstein-based manufactories. One of them has a particular talent for making a substance used by Citadel warships, resulting in Boltzmann being one of the most heavily patrolled areas in Citadel space.
Due to heavy commercial development, Boltzmann's worlds only have moderate to poor amounts of resources available for the Normandy SR-2.
