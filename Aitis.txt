Description[]
The rock and ice planet Aitis's position was ideal for collecting data on extrasolar activity. According to star charts, the asari had a small, VI-run system of satellites in geosynchronous orbit with the planet. This system broadcast the first warning that Reapers had come through the mass relay, and mangled metal around the planet indicates that the Reapers did not appreciate their presence being advertised.
