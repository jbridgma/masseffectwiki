Agent Armor is a brand of turian armor made by Aldrin Labs. Available in light and medium variations, it is the standard issue for turian C-Sec officers and is Garrus Vakarian's default armor. Medium Agent Armor shares the same attributes as Medium Hydra Armor, another of Aldrin Labs' products, and also has inferior stats to most armors made by other companies due to the use of kinetic plastite.[1]
