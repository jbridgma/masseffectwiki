Description[]
Pheiros is an asteroid towed near the class-B blue giant Gemmae to serve as a terrestrial military base in a system devoid of planets. A vast array of solar collectors absorb energy from the star and beam it to receptors near the tidally locked asteroid's terminator zone. Beneath the surface, dozens of particle accelerators generate antiprotons for starship fuel.
The Reapers sent a substantial force to Gemmae's system but found that the turians were capable and prepared to defend their armada's fuel source. Warning messages say the Reapers are still present in the system, awaiting reinforcements. At present, the turians can still refuel--but only because they committed forces here that could otherwise have defended Palaven.
