Description[]
While some militaries pass on the Hurricane because of its lower accuracy, the Alliance feels the gun's rapid firing rate offers excellent suppressive fire. A disciplined marksman can use the fully automatic submachine gun to chew through targets with alarming speed. Alliance officers were so pleased with field results that the Hurricane is now many squadrons' standard-issue SMG.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
The N7 Hurricane is included in the N7 Collector's Edition Pack as a bonus item for players who order the Collector's or Digital Deluxe Edition of Mass Effect 3. An e-mail is received as part of the acquisition package.




N7 Weaponry


From: Lt. D. Eugene

Commander Shepard:

Your VI, EDI, put in a request to me for a handful of N7-grade weapons. Happy to oblige. I led the engineers who retrofitted the Normandy when it was turned over to the Alliance. EDI kept me company when we were overhauling the Normandy's interior. She's a beautiful ship, Commander. I'll miss working on her.

I left the guns in your weapons locker.

Best of luck,
Lieutenant D. Eugene

Alliance Engineering Corp.


In the Legendary Edition it is available from the Spectre Requisitions terminal in the Citadel Embassies for a base amount of 75,000 credits.

Multiplayer
Weapons are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The N7 Hurricane is categorized as ultra-rare and requires no multiplayer expansion packs.

Player Notes[]
GeneralSingle-playerMultiplayer
General
The N7 Hurricane is hands down the most powerful SMG in terms of raw damage output, with both an extreme rate of fire and high damage per bullet. Using any other SMG model over the Hurricane generally comes down to simple availability, or if you want an advantage on one specific attribute in exchange for less damage.
The M-12 Locust and the M-9 Tempest are both lighter, more accurate, and easier to control.
The Hurricane out-damages both the Blood Pack Punisher and the Collector SMG (multiplayer only) even against armored targets for the same weight, but both of the latter options are easier to control and more accurate at range. The Collector SMG also has the advantage of not needing thermal clips, and the Punisher has lower clip usage due to its lower rate of fire.
The Geth Plasma SMG is much lighter and has a longer and faster rate of sustained fire once it spins up.
The Hurricane's main weakness is its extremely high recoil, even more so when zoomed in and especially when scoped. For this reason, firing the gun from the hip is recommended. The SMG Recoil System can help alleviate this problem, as can firing from cover. The Hurricane is also not that accurate, and since using a scope is not practical, it is basically not effective at longer range.
The high firing rate of the Hurricane depletes thermal clips very quickly, finishing your entire reserve in seconds. Maintaining this weapon requires frequent ammo resupplying. Equipping the SMG Heat Sink greatly mitigates this weakness.
The Hurricane effectively only has a thermal clip size of 20, as each bullet fired uses 2 rounds from the thermal clip. This also means that if the magazine is augmented by the use of a Level III SMG Magazine Upgrade, the Hurricane will have a magazine capacity of 63, and it will not fire if there is just 1 round left in the magazine. This behavior will also cause automatic reloading to fail, necessitating the use of the Reload button.
For a rapid-fire weapon, the Hurricane has a very good chance-per-shot of triggering the effects of most ammo powers/ammo bonuses, including Cryo Ammo which will freeze most unprotected targets. This makes it effective for setting enemies up for Power Combos.
Combining the SMG High-Velocity Barrel with the SMG Ultralight Materials mods turns the Hurricane into easily the most effective anti-armor weapon for its weight in the game. If you can weaken enemy armor sufficiently using powers like Warp, you can use the SMG High Caliber Barrel instead for even more damage.
The sheer killing power of the N7 Hurricane, combined with its light weight (especially when combined with SMG Ultralight Materials), make it a reasonable alternative to a Shotgun or Assault Rifle for any class.
The Marksman power can make the Hurricane accurate at range, but it also exacerbates its high recoil and thermal clip consumption.
Single-player
The Hurricane works very well as a weapon for squadmates, since they are accurate, and they ignore both thermal clip usage and muzzle climb. It's an excellent way to increase the damage of squadmates that can't carry heavier weapons, like Liara T'Soni and EDI. Squadmates will fire long, sustained bursts with the weapon, which can make them more susceptible to return fire.
Multiplayer
The Hurricane can be very effective in the hands of the turian classes because of the weapon damage and stability bonuses from the passive class powers Turian Veteran and Armiger Legion. The Geth Juggernaut Soldier's class passive also provides a significant stability bonus.
The Turian Soldier is even more effective with this weapon with Marksman; though the faster rate of fire can make the muzzle climb even more severe, the increases to accuracy and damage tend to make up for this.
With enough stability bonuses, it's even feasible to equip the SMG Scope, making the Hurricane accurate at long range and even more damaging by being able to hit enemy heads or weak points reliably.
The Barrage Upgrade gear item also pairs very well with the Hurricaneâ€”it increases spare ammo and reduces recoil, helping to mitigate the two major drawbacks of the weapon. Pairing this with a single-use Targeting VI will make the Hurricane capable of obliterating the heads of infantry.
The N7 Destroyer Soldier will destroy almost everything at close range with the Hurricane while Devastator Mode is active, benefitting from extra magazine capacity, rate of fire, accuracy, and damage.
An especially powerful combination for power-heavy classes (ex. basic Human Adept, N7 Fury Adept, Quarian Engineer) is to use both the N7 Hurricane and the Acolyte pistol. The Acolyte staggers enemies and strips them of their shields, making it an ideal choice for dealing with foot soldiers. The N7 Hurricane's high sustained damage per pecond (DPS) makes it an excellent choice for dealing with hard targets, especially when using the SMG High-Velocity Barrel for armor piercing and the SMG Ultralight Materials to keep power cooldowns brisk, despite the Hurricane's relatively high weight. This particular setup can deal with virtually any situation the player may come across.

Description[]
A disciplined marksman can hit targets with alarming speed using this submachine gun. In the Milky Way, the Hurricane was standard issue in many Systems Alliance Squads. Its proponents demanded that a small stock be acquired for the Andromeda Initiative's security forces.

Features[]
The multiplayer Hurricane gained improvements to damage, clip size, and max ammo through post-launch updates.
