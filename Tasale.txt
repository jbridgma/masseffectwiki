Tasale is a gateway system in more than one way, first to the rest of the cluster, and also between the Asari Republics and the Terminus Systems. It is home to the strategically important asari entrepot Illium. Its worlds rate moderate to rich in terms of resources required by the Normandy SR-2, particularly in palladium deposits, although most of that is untapped by commercial interests. Helium-3 mining infrastructure building in Naxell to service Illium is progressing, although hampered by cutthroat competition from outside the cluster.
