Eskaal is a member of the angaran Resistance and medic on Voeld.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Eskaal is located in the clinic of the Angaran Resistance Base where he treats injured fighters due to bolder kett's tactics. 
When Eskaal meets Pathfinder Ryder, he may give an explanation the importance of sunlight for his people. The sunlight is necessary for the angara who generates their bio energy from it. Without enough sunlight, an angara may go "dark" as its bio energy slows and immune system weakens. The Angara, who comes from Aya or Havarl need a strong adjustment to the life conditions on Voeld. The cold and the lack of sun are bad for moral and for immunity: people get sick. This is why he stands near a heat generator that produces an artificial sunlight.
