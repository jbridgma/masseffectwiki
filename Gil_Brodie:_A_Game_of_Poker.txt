Poker awaits!
To: Ryder
From: Gil
Ryder, the bell tolls for thee. Meet me in the Vortex on the Nexus. I'll be the one shuffling the deck of doom.

Cheers,

Gil


Meet Gil at the Vortex[]
Gil will be waiting in The Vortex on the Nexus. Talk with him to play a game of poker. SAM privately informs Ryder that he can give an advantage during the game.
If you accept, Ryder will end Gil's winning streak. If you decline, Gil thrashes Ryder handily. Either way, Gil tells you more about his friend Jill. 
If you win by cheating and then confess to the deed, Gil just laughs it off.
The mission is complete once the conversation is over.
