Project Elites are enemies encountered during the assignment Arrival.







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




Project Elites will attack Commander Shepard throughout Project Base. They are first encountered during the Object Rho sequence of the assignment and will attack in up to five waves, along with Project Guards, Project Pyros, and Project Engineers. Later, they are usually accompanied by at least two Project Guards or larger groups of Project forces.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Project Elites are equipped with the M-15 Vindicator assault rifle and they possess Disruptor Ammo on all difficulties.  
Defensive
Project Elites have good shielding on all difficulties, which will be augmented on higher difficulties. They will use Tech Armor to restore their shields if depleted. 

Tactics[]
Because Elites, like enemy Engineers, can recharge their shields when left alone for too long, gradually chipping away at them doesn't work well.  When you do attack them, hit them hard and fast and don't let them hide in cover too long.  Powers such as Combat Drone, Inferno Grenade, Flashbang Grenade, and Shockwave are good at forcing them out of cover, as can the shots of certain heavy weapons.
They do extreme damage, but they often tend to hang back in cover and snipe carefully so it's usually better to focus on eliminating easier or more aggressive enemies first before attacking them.
If a Project Pyro is nearby, try to detonate him and catch the Elite in the blast.
