Location: Milky Way / Horsehead Nebula / Anadius

Prerequisite: Priority: Cerberus Headquarters

Description[]
The MIa red supergiant Anadius is a minor footnote on the star maps of the Horsehead Nebula: a cold, dying star of about 20 solar masses and 1,500 times Sol's radius. Not listed on any charts, an unobtrusive space station is nearly imperceptible in the star's periodic bursts of solar output.
EDI'S ADVISORY: The size and shape of the station suggest many ships could dock in it--precise measurements would require active scans, which could reveal the Normandy's presence. Given the stakes, this level of accuracy is not recommended.
