Description[]
Tidally locked to its parent star, Mil, Akraia is a small rock-planet that never bore much development due to the asari on Chalkhos and Selvos having limited resources and instead focusing their efforts on more welcoming worlds. Old scans indicate that it may have an abundance of nickel.

Trivia[]
In Greek mythology, Akraia is one of Hera's nurses.
