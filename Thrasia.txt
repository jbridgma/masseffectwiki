Thrasia is an arms dealer on Kadara.






“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Pathfinder Ryder can encounter Thrasia on a wind farm at Varren's Scalp. The entrepreneur sells a navpoint to a weapons cache that she neglects to tell her buyers that she also sold to multiple other parties.
If Ryder confronts Thrasia about having to fight Exiles over the cache she nonchalantly discloses her side deals. She doesn't want angry customers, however, so she provides a substantial discount or asking price for anything the Pathfinder has to trade.
Thrasia sells upgrades and paint jobs for the ND1 Nomad as well as various Resources.
