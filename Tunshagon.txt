Description[]
Tunshagon is a hydrogen-helium gas giant with traces of chlorine and nitrogen in its atmosphere. It has an unusually small number of moons for a gas giant; a mere seven. This is likely due to the star Farinata capturing the majority of the mass during the nebular collapse that created the system.

Properties[]
Tunshagon is too small and hot to be a "standard hydrogen-helium gas giant" (William Hubbard, The New Solar System 4th ed, 1999; p. 194). In addition its near 18 sol-mass star means that even "ice giants" of this radius are impossible (due to Farinata's young age and heat). Tunshagon is more likely a superterrestrial protoplanet.
