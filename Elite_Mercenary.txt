Player Notes[]
"Charge" referred to in Rank 1 for this power is the same thing as a Grenade. This means that grenades recharge over time for the player based on the Charge Regeneration Speed.
Charge Regeneration Speed changes based on weapon weight the same way power cooldowns do. The Talon Mercenary only has grenade-based powers and no normal powers for cooldowns.
