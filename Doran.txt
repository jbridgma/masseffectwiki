If Shepard agrees to help Schells the salarian gambler to gather data from the Quasar gambling machines, Doran takes notice and comments suspiciously on the Commander's "luck". Shepard can turn Schells' scanning device over to Doran, who is annoyed at Schells, but grateful for the help. Later, Doran's dancing mood sets in, and he can be found on the nightclub's dance floor. Shepard has the opportunity to join in.
Doran is privy to the issues between two sisters under his employ, Rita and Jenna. When Jenna left Flux to work at Chora's Den, he claims he's open to rehiring her, only that she doesn't want to go back. He advises Rita to be careful in dealing with her stubborn sister, so as not to alienate her further.
