Overview[]
Class type requirements were removed in Mass Effect: Andromeda. The same requirements were removed from weapons as well. Characters and weapons are highly customizable in Mass Effect: Andromeda differing greatly from previous Mass Effect games. 
Weapons can be found dropped from enemies, looted from containers, purchased from merchants, or by Development (crafting) at a Research Center.
Each weapon counts as one item towards the Inventory item limit.

Combat Style[]
In addition to weapons, combat also allows use of Flak Cannons, Grenades, Trip Mines, etc. Adding points to Tech skills, allows focusing more on experimental weapons, such as the Flamethrower and the Cryo Beam. Enemies are not generally classified as 'weapons' so are not listed here, but by using Biotic skills can, in fact, temporarily turn an enemy into a weapon, either as a shield or to do damage to another enemy.

Weapon Types[]
 Milky Way - Similar to weapons found in Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3 but upgraded.
 Heleus - This type of weapon is generally plasma based and benefits from heat-seeking technology. Some Heleus weapons are also charged based. The longer they are charged before releasing the trigger, the more devastating the impact.
 Remnant - Typically use beams, have a high rate of fire and are exceptionally accurate, though they typically lack per-shot damage compared to Heleus or Milky Way weapons. Due to rising heat, the weapon will experience occasional cooldown requirements. A fair trade-off considering this weapon type does not require carrying extra ammunition.

Weapon Loadout[]
Weapons can only be added/changed/removed at a Loadout terminal.
The number of weapons Ryder can carry will depend on the skill points placed into the Combat Fitness skill.
Note:  Squad weapons can't be changed in Mass Effect: Andromeda. See Squad - Mass Effect: Andromeda

Weapon Weight[]
Total weapon weight is affected by the number and type of weapons chosen at the Loadout terminal.

For details on the mechanics of weapon weight, see Combat (Mass Effect: Andromeda)#Weight Capacity.
Melee weapons are weightless but each firearm adds more weight.
If Ryder carries too much weight, power recharge times are affected.
Certain Skills can increase overall weight capacity.
Auxiliary Systems - Rank 4
Barrier (skill) - Rank 5 (while activated)
Combat Fitness - Ranks 3 & 5
Certain Skills can reduce the weight of specific weapons.
Assault Rifles (skill) - Rank 4
Pistols (skill) - Rank 4
Shotguns (skill) - Rank 4
Sniper Rifles (skill) - Rank 4
Certain Mods can reduce the weight of guns.
SR Ultra-Light Materials
SR Experimental Materials
SR Latticed Materials
Certain Mods can increase the weight of guns.
Pistol Heavy Magazine
Pistol Heavy Scope
AR Heavy Magazine
AR Heavy Stock
Shotgun Heavy Melee
SR Heavy Clip
SR Tactical Scope
Weapon Customization[]
Weapons can be customized by two different methods in Mass Effect: Andromeda. 

Weapon Modifications[]
Main article: Mods
Mods are customizations that are exclusive to weapons only in Mass Effect: Andromeda. Mods use round-shaped sockets on a weapon and can only be changed at a Loadout terminal.

Weapon Augmentations[]
Main article: Augmentations
Augmentations are semi-permanent customizations to crafted weapons or armor in Mass Effect: Andromeda. When a weapon is created during Development (crafting), hexagonal-shaped sockets are available to add Augmentations to the weapon. These augmentations cannot be changed like weapon Mods and stay part of that weapon until it is deconstructed.

Weapon Buff Mechanics[]
The customization of a weapon in Mass Effect: Andromeda can change stats of Pathfinder Ryder's other weapons. This is known as a buff. There are active and passive buffs based upon the weapon type.

Active Buffs[]
Active Buffs change weapon stats when a weapon is currently equipped. All gun-type weapons use active buffs. Active buffs change weapon stats for all weapons and are in place as long as Pathfinder Ryder has the weapon equipped. If Ryder changes to a different weapon, the buffs from the new weapon will now be in effect.
Active buffs are a moot point for other weapons. Unequipped weapon stats will be changed by an active buff but if Pathfinder Ryder changes weapons to use another weapon, the new weapon buffs are now in place. 

Passive Buffs[]
Passive Buffs change weapon stats no matter which weapon is currently equipped. All melee weapons use passive buffs. Passive buffs change weapon stats and are in place no matter which weapon Pathfinder Ryder has equipped.
Passive buffs are a completely different story. If Pathfinder Ryder isn't currently using the melee weapon with passive buffs, the passive buffs are still in place. All weapons Pathfinder Ryder current has in the Loadout are affected by passive buffs.

Buff Strategies[]
Depending upon playstyle, Pathfinder Ryder can have a melee weapon customized with Augmentations that buff all weapons but the melee weapon never actually has to be used during combat. As an added bonus, all melee weapons have no weight and therefore won't impact Recharge Speed.
For example: 

using an Asari Sword which has four augmentation slots
with the Innovation Cryo Pod Perk which grants one additional augmentation slot
and applying five Kinetic Coil augmentations which grant +3% Weapon Damage each, +15% Weapon Damage total
will change any weapon that Pathfinder Ryder has in the current Loadout to have the +15% Weapon Damage passive buff in place.
Multiplayer Variants[]
When a weapon reaches Rank X in multiplayer, item packs subsequently dispense variants of the weapon that come with additional abilities or improved stats, and can be upgraded again from Ranks I-X. These are the S, Bulwark, Concussive, and Siphon variants.
S weapons confer different stats per weapon. The Bulwark, Concussive, and Siphon variants all confer the same effects and rank gains regardless of weapon. The latter three variants also retain the Rank X stats of the base weapon, with subsequent I-X upgrades only making the variant effect stronger. The weapon effects also end when switching to another gun.
While base weapons can't be taken to the field twice, different variants of the same weapon can. It's possible to bring an Avenger X and an Avenger S, an Avenger Siphon and an Avenger Concussive, and so on.

S[]
Nexus scientists have worked to improve APEX weaponry, creating enhanced Special Edition weapons that are showcased in a titanium finish.
M-3 Predator S
Charger S
M-8 Avenger S
M-23 Katana S
Viper S
The five Common weapons are given "S" variants, sporting boosted damage compared to the originals. The remaining stats stay the same: a Rank I common weapon has the same stats as a Rank I S weapon except for damage, and will continue on the same vein until Rank X.
Unlike the other variants, which inherit the rarity of the base gun, S weapons are classified as Rare.

Bulwark[]
This weapon upgrade is based on tech accidentally discovered while creating shield generators. The Bulwark's user takes less damage from all sources when standing near allies—the more allies, the stronger the effect.
Gain Damage Resistance with each nearby ally.
+15-25 Damage Resistance Near One Ally
+22-37 Damage Resistance Near Two Allies
+30-50 Damage Resistance Near Three Allies
Bulwark weapons' paint scheme is yellow with grey hexagons. A bluish shimmer envelopes the user when the damage resistance effect is active, and the effect is active only up to a certain distance between teammates. The weapons are typically appropriate to use during defensive actions requiring teammates close together, such as in Hack or Upload waves, or during Devices or Retrieval waves when one works the objective while another squadmate stands guard nearby, though they can also be deployed offensively if the team acts cohesively. Spawned drones are not counted as "allies" by the Bulwark effect.

Concussive[]
Initiative scientists have outdone themselves with this weapon upgrade. Using this upgrade to kill an enemy with a headshot causes a massive explosion, essentially turning the target into a bomb.
Killing an enemy by shooting its weakpoint causes an explosion.
+800-1500 Area Damage
+7.50 Radius (m)
Concussive weapons' paint scheme is purple with grey stripes. This variant is not available for certain weapons, such as those that fire grenade munitions like the M-37 Falcon or Venom Shotgun. Concussive weapons are devastating against clumped enemies, since just killing a guy via weakpoint also damages (and potentially kills) those around them.

Siphon[]
This weapon upgrade was developed by angaran scientists excited to experiment with biotics for the first time. The Siphon heals the user while shooting enemies and temporarily increases the amount of healing with fatal shots.
This weapon restores your health as it deals damage.
+3.00-3.75% Damage Returned As Health
+4.50% Heal Bonus Per Kill
+7 Kill Streak Duration (seconds)
+3 Maximum Kill Bonuses
Siphon weapons' paint scheme is red with a large grey stripe. Concentric red holo-circles appear on the weapon barrel after each kill, with an audible whine that also grows louder after each kill. Siphon weapons are versatile on the battlefield compared to the other variants, with a utilitarian life-restoring effect that's always welcome no matter the situation.
