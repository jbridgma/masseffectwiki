Fortack's Database is one of two shops in the Urdnot Camp, the other shop being Ratch's Wares. It is located in the "Med-Lab" section of the map, across from the Krogan mechanic. Here Fortack is either developing sophisticated and destructive weapons, or researching more "frivolous things" such as crop genetics and medicinal improvements, depending on whether Urdnot Wreav or Urdnot Wrex is in charge of the Urdnots.
His store terminal offers a variety of weapon upgrades, which reflect Fortack's combat-oriented interests.
