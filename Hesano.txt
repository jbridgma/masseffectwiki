Description[]
Hesano is a standard hydrogen-helium gas giant. Two hundred years ago, an independent volus prospector found the mangled wreck of a Prothean starship trapped within the trailing Lagrange point. Few artifacts from the wreckage have been recovered.
The prospector, Lumen Kreop, was canny enough to keep the hulk's existence to himself. He sold its location to a turian paleotechnology firm for nearly a million credits. Since then, Hesano's Lagrange points, rings, and moons have been combed over by fortune hunters seeking to strike it rich the same way. Thus far, no additional artifacts have been recovered.
