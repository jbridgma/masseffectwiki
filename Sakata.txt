Description[]
A large Venusian hothouse, Sakata's rough weather and active magnetosphere has a reputation for confounding or destroying space probes launched to investigate it. What has been discovered is that its dense atmosphere is largely carbon dioxide and sodium and its surface, lime. Its magnetosphere suggests an iron-rich core, but its heavy gravity precludes most development.

Trivia[]
The world may be named after Shoichi Sakata, a theoretical physicist renowned for his work on subatomic particles. He mentored Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa, both Nobel laureates who also may have lent their names to other planets in Yakawa.
