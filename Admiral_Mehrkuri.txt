Description[]
Pressha is a relatively small hydrogen-helium gas giant with large amounts of hydrocarbons in the middle layers of the atmosphere.
When the Krogan Rebellions ended three millennia ago, the turian chief of naval operations, a distinguished soldier named Mehrkuri, declared his immediate retirement. He disappeared into what was then uncharted territory. It was only two hundred years ago that his ship was found on the surface of Pressha's largest moon. It had landed gently and been deliberately shut down. Of Admiral Mehrkuri, however, no trace was ever found.

Properties[]
Pressha is too small to be a "standard hydrogen-helium gas giant" (William Hubbard, The New Solar System 4th ed, 1999; p. 194). It is more likely a dense "ice giant" like Neptune or Gliese 436 b.

Trivia[]
The planet info says the Krogan Rebellions have ended 3000 years ago. This is inconsistent with other sources in the game, which give less than half that.
While the name Pressha was produced by using a random-name generator, the name did inspire the writers to think of the song "Under Pressure" by Queen and David Bowie. As a result, the character Admiral Mehrkuri was named in reference to Queen vocalist Freddie Mercury.
