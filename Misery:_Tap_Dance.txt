Misery: Tap Dance was an assignment in Mass Effect which was cut during development. It would be the most important assignment related to Misery, displaying a vast number of different characters during a search for decisive evidence.

Plotline[]
The assignment could be started by speaking to "Mira" who would make an "offer." Commander Shepard has the choice between refusing the offer, or agreeing "to help TAP." It would be possible to talk about "spies" to someone named Grant, whose conversation would depend on Lorn's fate during the course of Misery: The Lost Mechanic. Before starting to gather "evidence," Shepard could also offer to help find some "probes" for Grant. In addition, Shepard could talk to two people named Rickard and Arden.
Eventually, Shepard would come to gather evidence and decide what to do with it. Both "TAP" and the Phanes Corporation would be willing to pay for it, and whichever the player sides with would damage the other in some way. Shepard's decision in this matter would also elicit different reactions on Grant's part later on, who appears to be siding with Phanes Corporation. In any case, making this choice would complete the assignment.[1]
