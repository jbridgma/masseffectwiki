Player Notes[]
Mechanics
While the headshot mechanic might seem like it requires careful aim, it can be easily done without aiming down the weapon sights, if the enemy is not too far away.
The Rank 6 Shield-Powered option can be paired with multiple shield cost reduction passives, such as Ryder's Profiles. The only other power with this mechanic is Nova.
Lance reaches its destination nearly instantaneously, meaning that unlike other powers such as Throw or Incinerate, enemies will not be able to dodge the projectile effectively.
Strategies
One of the more powerful skills in the game, it is commonly exploited in multiplayer for high experience from combos.
Pairs excellently with rifles at long range, especially when the weapon's clip is empty.
Combining the Rank 6 Shield-Powered option with Annihilation's Rank 6 Draining Field option allows for frequent use of Lance, especially when used around clusters of weak enemies or with the passive shield power cost reductions from Ryder's passive skills and Profiles.
