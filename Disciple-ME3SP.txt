Description[]
Originally handcrafted for the exclusive use of justicars, the Disciple Shotgun's schematics were finally released to asari commandos after centuries of negotiation. The Disciple uses shells packed with microscale submunitions to deal staggering amounts of damage. Even shielded enemies are stunned by the force of a blast from this weapon.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
The Disciple can be found during the mission Kallini: Ardat-Yakshi Monastery in a small room shortly after speaking with Falere the first time. It is also purchasable from Nos Astra Sporting Goods post-mission if it was missed.

Multiplayer
Weapons are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The Disciple is categorized as rare and requires no multiplayer expansion packs.

Player Notes[]
The Disciple is one of the more accurate standard shotguns. Adding a Shotgun Smart Choke or using Marksman will make the Disciple even more precise.
It is also the lightest shotgun, allowing for more power usage or an extra weapon without seriously hurting power cooldown times. Power-intensive classes are most likely to benefit from this weapon. As to be expected though, the tradeoff is far less stopping power than most heavier shotguns or the slightly heavier M-358 Talon heavy pistol.
The Talon also has the advantage of being able to equip a more effective lightweight materials mod as well as other potentially more useful weapon mods such as a scope or power damage enhancement.
One of the best ways to squeeze the most damage out of the Disciple is to equip the Smart Choke and focus on landing headshots.
The Disciple is useful for classes that are only looking to use a shotgun as a melee weapon with the Shotgun Omni-Blade equipped and otherwise want to be as unencumbered as possible.
The Disciple has a fair reload time; however, it is slower compared to the M-23 Katana or M-27 Scimitar.
The Disciple's in-game description claims it will always stun enemies, when in actuality it only increases the stun chance that most weapons have. However, it has the advantage of staggering most infantry and even certain heavier targets that are protected by armor, shields, or barriers.
When an infantry-type enemy is fatally shot by the Disciple its body is blown backwards, an especially useful feature when fighting Abominations. This occurs even with fatal headshot kills, as the Disciple does not destroy enemy heads like many weapons do; this makes it impossible to prevent the explosions of Abominations or Possessed Abominations with the weapon.

Description[]
A relatively lightweight shotgun originally built in the Milky Way for asari justicars and commandos. The semi-automatic Disciple uses shells packed with microscale submunitions to inflict serious damage. The Initiative have only a small number of Disciples due to the asari's unwillingness to freely share their design.
