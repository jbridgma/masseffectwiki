Jirayder is a system southeast of the Heleus Cluster's Black Hole. It is one FTL jump away from Faroang.
The system has been drastically affected by the Scourge. A primitive intelligent species used to have a homeworld here, although they may have gone extinct after the emergence of the phenomenon. Barren worlds that used to have water and planets with altered orbits are other textbook examples.
Kallo Jath considers Jirayder a "lonely system", as it is almost lost in the Scourge.
