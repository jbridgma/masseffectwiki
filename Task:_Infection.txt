Acquisition[]
The task starts when Pathfinder Ryder has found and scanned a dead scavenger in a camp on Elaaden.

Walkthrough[]
Scan the scavenger's bodies[]
The scavenger bodies in question are generated at random but can be found at scavenger outposts dotted all over the map. The bodies will be marked with . If a camp doesn't have a corpse, the camp might have a corpse the next time upon next visit. If a camp has a corpse, SAM (or a squadmate) will comment on the presence of the corpse. 
Once three bodies are scanned, SAM will prompt Ryder that the death was caused by ingestion of contaminated meat and provide the navpointto the alleged source.

Investigate the disease source[]
The navpoint is located in the Sea of Ataraxia at the Northeastern Monolith.

Search for the radiation source[]
Some leaking canisters on the ground are the source of the radiation. There would be a few creatures roaming about  - Kaerkyns, Spitbugs and even Echidnas depending on map state -  and SAM detects the radiation off them.
Make the radioactive canisters inert[]
Interact with the canisters to render them inert. Because disabling them takes more than a few seconds, it is recommended to clear out the immediate area of wildlife before attempting to do so. When the canisters are disabled, the mission then ends.

Rewards[]
+270 XP
+29 AVP 
+2% Elaaden viability
