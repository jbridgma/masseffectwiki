“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Maisi is a supply officer for the Angaran Resistance Base on Voeld and a friend of Jaal Ama Darav. According to her, Evfra de Tershaav has bold plans for the resistance and she is willing to help the effort even if some angara speak ill of Evfra. 
She is tasked to ship supplies through caves and hidden paths scattered around the planet. As it is hard to fly into different resistance bases, her children run most items through the caves. Their size allows them to move undetected by the kett. When she first meets Pathfinder Ryder, she has nothing to sell as her supplies are low. However, she says that if Ryder manages to destroy the kett station located on the south road, she could be able to bring more supplies and spare some for Ryder.

Trivia[]
Maisi does not become a merchant. She keeps repeating the same excuse and sells nothing even if the Pathfinder clears the kett station.
