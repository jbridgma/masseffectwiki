This article is about assault rifle weapons in Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3, and Mass Effect: Andromeda. For the talent in Mass Effect, see Assault Rifles (talent). For the skill in Mass Effect: Andromeda, see Assault Rifles (skill).


Assault rifles are one of the primary weapons in the Mass Effect universe. Extensively used by factions across the galaxy, assault rifles generally offer mid-range stopping power, more accuracy than submachine guns, and overheat allowances larger than shotguns, pistols/heavy pistols, or sniper rifles.

Mass Effect[]
Assault rifles are effective for any combat situation at almost any but the very farthest engagement distances where their high recoil and lack of accuracy make precision shooting difficult. Short, controlled bursts, and firing from cover and/or a crouching stance are usually required to hit anything at long range. At close range, spraying bullets into a target is effective, if not as quick as a shotgun blast. Characters with access to the Assault Rifles talent can use these weapons more effectively.
Assault rifles have a base rate of fire of 10 shots per second.

Mass Effect 2[]
Assault rifles in Mass Effect 2 are a class of rapid firing ranged weapons, which also encompasses battle rifles, marksman rifles and light machine guns.  Like all other non-heavy weapon types in Mass Effect 2 with the exception of sniper rifles, assault rifles benefit from increasing damage against targets at close ranges, maximized at point-blank (melee) range.  The Soldier is the only player class that starts with training in assault rifles, while other player classes may choose to specialize in assault rifles later during the game. The following squadmates also utilize assault rifles: Garrus, Grunt, Legion, Morinth, Samara, and Zaeed.

Mass Effect 3[]
No longer exclusive to the Soldier, Assault Rifles are a viable option for any class. Their consistent rate of fire and damage output makes them an appealing choice, though most lack the potential for high burst damage available to many shotguns, sniper rifles, and even some heavy pistols. Several assault rifle models do not fire bullets, but instead utilize explosive rounds.
Most assault rifles can have their accuracy boosted by aiming down sights (zooming) and by sticking to cover, which also increases stability, reducing muzzle climb. Like sniper rifles, assault rifles can also be modded with advanced thermal scopes that not only increase accuracy but also enhance vision to see invisible enemies or through smoke and objects.
The following squadmates utilize assault rifles: Ashley, Garrus, James, Javik, Kaidan, Grunt, Nyreen, Samara, and Zaeed.

Assault Rifles Customization[]
Assault Rifles can be customized by two different methods in Mass Effect: Andromeda. 

Weapon Modifications[]
Main article: Mods
Mods are customizations that are exclusive to weapons only in Mass Effect: Andromeda. Mods use round-shaped sockets on a weapon and can only be changed at a Loadout terminal.

Weapon Augmentations[]
Main article: Augmentations
Augmentations are semi-permanent customizations to crafted weapons or armor in Mass Effect: Andromeda. When a weapon is created during Development (crafting), hexagonal-shaped sockets are available to add augmentations to the weapon. These augmentations cannot be changed like weapon Mods and stay part of that weapon until it is deconstructed.
