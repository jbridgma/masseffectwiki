Description[]
A simple but powerful merger of Remnant and Initiative technology, the Equalizer fires high-energy particle blasts that lose coherence and become ineffectual over distances. The short-range Equalizer does not require reloading, but will overheat from continuous use. Initiative researchers are eager to see more field-test data.

Features[]
Powerful and accurate, the Equalizer is a valuable addition to any armory. Its damage output is higher than that of most assault rifles and trumped only by the M-25 Hornet submachine gun, but unlike the Hornet's burst-fire mode, the Equalizer provides fully automatic fire at an extreme rate. It also weighs slightly less than the average assault rifle.
Being a Remnant weapon, the Equalizer is subject to all the advantages and drawbacks of this weapon family. 
Its internal heat sink gives it infinite spare ammunition, but its immense rate of fire means that it empties its clip in no time, which forces it into its lengthy cooldown animation if the player fails to keep an eye on their ammo count. A high-level Pistol Magazine mod goes a long way to make the most of its withering hail of fire.
The Equalizer is completely useless outside close quarters combat because its projectiles simply dissipate past its effective range. Therefore the gun either deals full damage to the target, or none at all if it is even an inch too far away.
Like all Remnant weapons, the Equalizer can only be acquired by crafting it at a Research Station. It will never appear as random loot or in APEX loot containers.

Strategies[]

The Equalizer is a "high risk, high reward" weapon. Upgraded and equipped with a Pistol Long Barrel and a good Pistol Magazine mod, it can kill just about anything short of boss creatures in a single clip. However, the gun's short effective range means that players will often have to get up close to enemies that are at their most lethal in melee, like Fiends or Ascendants. Whether this risk is worth the reward or not comes down to player preference and general play style.
Crafting the Equalizer with a Seeking Plasma System makes for an interesting combination that can work wonders on higher difficulty settings. It allows Ryder to just hunker down in cover and dispense auto-targeting homing death in all directions without having to worry about running out of ammunition. While this tends to make large-scale shootouts a lot easier, the slow speed of the SPS's projectiles means that Ryder can quickly find themselves in trouble when up against highly mobile melee enemies of all stripes. It is therefore recommended to carry a powerful hitscan weapon effective at point-blank range to counter these threats if this approach is taken.
