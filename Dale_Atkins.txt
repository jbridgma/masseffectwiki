Dale Atkins is the perpetrator of a string of sabotaged maintenance panels on the Nexus. He is a security guard who reports to Tiran Kandros' department, presently reassigned to the Hyperion.

Background[]
Prior to the Hyperion's arrival there was an uprising instigated by disgruntled workers over the Nexus leadership's lack of transparency and actual leadership. Krogan were deployed to violently suppress dissenters, many of them friends of Dale's. The mutineers were booted off the station into exile, and Dale's sister was among them.
Dale stayed aboard the Nexus but quietly harbored his sympathies to the mutineers. He has taken to rigging maintenance panels to explode, potentially burning techs working on them. He has taken steps to erase his complicity by setting up  Raj Patil and Zarah Kellus to make them think the other is responsible, and he used his authorization to tamper with incriminating security feeds.

Mass Effect: Andromeda[]
Dale can be caught in the act messing with maintenance panels in the Hyperion by Pathfinder Ryder. He rants about his motivations, but ultimately he admits to the crimes and he doesn't care what happens to him. Ryder decides his fate: exile, or be handed over to the Nexus authorities for judgement. 
If Dale is exiled, he actually relishes being "let go" without any comeuppance and leaves without further incident. If he's handed over to the leadership, Dale scoffs at their decisionmaking capability, or lack thereof.
