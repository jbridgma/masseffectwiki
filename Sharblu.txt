Description[]
A standard hydrogen-helium gas giant, the methane in Sharblu's atmosphere gives it an azure hue.
The asari crew who initially surveyed the system (during Earth's 17th century) named Sharblu after a then-popular soprano. The singer was renowned for her unusual skin tone, which was quite similar to that of the planet.

Properties[]
Sharblu is too small to be a "standard hydrogen-helium gas giant" (William Hubbard, The New Solar System 4th ed, 1999; p. 194). In addition its 17.8 sol-mass star cannot have formed before 7.48 million years ago. It is too hot to attract ices. It is more likely a superterrestrial protoplanet. The clear gasses in its atmosphere will suffice to induce a Rayleigh scattering effect and an appearance of deep blue (with clouds).

Trivia[]
The planet description may be a reference in the film The Fifth Element which includes a blue asari-like alien soprano character called Diva Plavalaguna. The diva's name, Plavalaguna, means "blue lagoon" in several Slavic languages.
