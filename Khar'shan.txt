Description[]
Khar'shan, the batarian homeworld, is wrapped less in mystery than in outright lies. Batarian propaganda claims the world has 15 billion inhabitants and an economy that rivals the asari. Although the legal slave trade does boost the batarians' profits somewhat, Citadel sanctions have left a paper tiger of an empire, one that fights rivals through deniable terrorist actions rather than the wars of its heyday centuries ago.
The Reapers will likely be the death blow to that empire. Almost no information has escaped Khar'shan since the Reapers destroyed the comm buoys, but batarian refugees say that resistance has created a bond among the commoners. If a new government can rise from the ashes, that bond may sustain a new batarian society.

Additional Information[]
Khar'shan's harsh plains are home to the ignac, a spiky type of spice cone.
The waters of Khar'shan are also home to a black and yellow Snapping Eel that attacks fish larger than itself when hungry.
