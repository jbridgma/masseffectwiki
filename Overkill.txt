Assault Rifles is a combat-oriented talent available only to Soldiers, the Turian Agent, and the Krogan Battlemaster by default. Higher levels of the talent improves proficiency with assault rifle-type weapons. The Assault Rifles talent also unlocks the Overkill active ability, which functions somewhat differently in Legendary Edition.
Player characters with the Assault Rifles talent are able to aim down sights (ADS) with assault rifles, also referred to as "tight-aiming" or simply "zooming". This shrinks the size of the targeting reticle and improves accuracy.
Legendary Edition:  Any player character can zoom or tight-aim with any weapon to shrink its reticule and improve accuracy, no specific weapon talent is required. However, doing so will slow the player's movement.

Overkill[]

When active, Overkill allows for firing of the rifle for long periods, with seriously reduced overheating and extra accuracy.
Switching weapons, changing the equipped assault rifle to a different model, or modifying any upgrades currently installed on the rifle, will immediately cancel Overkill if it was active. This applies to all similar weapon talents in Mass Effect, for both Shepard and squadmates.

Overkill in Legendary Edition works largely as it did in the original game except that it has a much shorter 6 second duration and deals greatly increased damage during that period.
