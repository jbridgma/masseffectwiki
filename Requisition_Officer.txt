“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




After Commander Shepard becomes a Spectre, Captain Anderson suggests speaking to the Requisition Officer to acquire some new equipment. 
The Requisition Officer has already performed a check on Shepard, as he can only sell to authorized buyers. Once Shepard has become a Spectre, the Requisitions Officer initially thinks the system is malfunctioning, since it is telling him to offer Shepard their select stock. However, he soon realizes Shepard is the new Spectre he has been hearing about, and apologizes. He is a key source for Spectre - Master Gear.

Trivia[]
The Requisition Officer is referred to as the C-Sec Requisitions Officer in the Rich Achievement text in the original version of Mass Effect as well as the Prima game guide for the same.
