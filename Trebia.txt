Trebia is the turian home system. 15,000 years of civilization saw most of its worlds drained of resources, though they still maintain outposts, satellites, and other military facilities on them.
The Reapers hit locations around the system usable to the turians and reserved others, possibly for their own purposes later. They have subverted defense drones on Caelax while leaving Datriux facilities intact with a garrison force. They are presently occupied fighting the bulk of the turians on Palaven and its moons.
