Relic's worlds are mostly translated from the original hanar designations for them. The abundance of resources has caused a mining boom: hanar and drell robo-miners compete with krogan and vorcha manual labor, which sometimes spark race riots.
First Land serves as a homebase and discharge station for the numerous hanar and drell miners in the system. Starships often disappear at Preying Mouth while discharging static buildup, leading to travel advisories recommending berthing at First Land instead.
