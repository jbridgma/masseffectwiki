Description[]
The Sidewinder rapid-fire pistol is a newly developed weapon, crafted by Nexus exiles with materials and technologies unique to the Andromeda Initiative and the Heleus Cluster. Versatile and reliable, the Sidewinder is perfect for a user with few resources to fall back on.

Features[]
The Sidewinder is a solid mid-tier handgun whose looks, coupled with its 6-shot capacity, evoke the image of a futuristic revolver. It can be considered a middle ground between the basic Predator and the much more powerful Carnifex.
It is important to note that the Sidewinder is outperformed by the Carnifex pistol in all stats except spare ammo count and fire rate. A Carnifex I already boasts higher damage per shot than the Sidewinder can deal at tier X in both singleplayer and multiplayer, thus providing little incentive for to carry a Sidewinder into battle. 
This is compounded by the fact that in singleplayer the Sidewinder needs to be researched to become available for crafting whereas the Carnifex automatically unlocks new tiers as Ryder levels up, and since both crafting options are always available in parallel to each other, there is no "gap to bridge" while the player waits for more advanced weapons to unlock. The Sidewinder is also classified as rare which, while giving it one more augmentation slot, means it is much more unlikely to drop as random loot than the uncommon-rated Carnifex is.
Squadmate Peebee wields a Sidewinder as her weapon of choice.
The multiplayer Sidewinder received improvements to damage and max ammo during updates. Its reload speed also decreased to 0.75 seconds from 1.5 seconds.

Multiplayer
The Sidewinder is at best a sidearm, only deployed in battle for fun or to rack up points for Pistol Mastery challenges. Its lightweight construction even unupgraded ensures at least one other weapon can be taken for conventional fights.
