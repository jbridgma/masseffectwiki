“I doubt you could fathom it anyway.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Evolution follow.




During the conflict, Lieutenant Abrudas is under the command of General Desolas Arterius, and commands a complement of soldiers who found a downed turian research vessel that crashed on Shanxi. After receiving a false message from Desolas, she leads a squad of men to rendezvous with the General, subsequently falling into a trap. Abrudas then unwittingly provides the human mercenaries with the location of the downed research vessel.

Trivia[]
Abrudas is the first female turian to be visually depicted in the Mass Effect franchise. Before her, only two other turian females had ever been mentioned: Orinia and Dinara in the novel Mass Effect: Retribution.
