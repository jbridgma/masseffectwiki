Description[]
Nutus is a hydrogen-helium gas giant with high nitrogen content. It had several colonized moons.
Nutus's moon Etrat was home to the small-time Terminus Systems warlord, Rashtek Chass, who extracted tribute from the colonists on Triginta Petra and any travelers stopping by to refuel on helium-3. Rashtek's small navy appears to have fled to safer pastures in advance of the Reaper invasion.
