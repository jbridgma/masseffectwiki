Description[]
Morana is an icy planetoid smaller than Earth's moon. Many planetary geologists suspect it was once an Oort cloud "ice dwarf" which migrated inwards after an encounter with some other body. While the crust is frozen water ice, deeper layers are mostly silicates, with pockets of magnesium and aluminum. Morana is tidally locked to Pax; the same side always faces the sun.

Trivia[]
Morana is a goddess of winter, senility and death in Slavic mythology.
