Description[]
Nonviable[]
Voeld is a world going through an ice age. Once packed with dozens of urban centers, most of Voeld's angaran population now lives in scattered settlements. The remains of vast ancient cities are still entombed in ice.
ALERT: Voeld is a stronghold of the kett. Caution advised.

Viable[]
Voeld is a world going through an ice age. The now-active Remnant vault is raising global temperatures to more habitable levels, allowing the creation of the angaran-Initiative outpost Taerve Uni - meaning Forward together in angaran language. (Founded by Pathfinder Ryder; Mayor Priya Blake elected.)
ALERT: A kett presence is still reported on Voeld. Caution advised.

Codex Entry[]

Initial Entry[]
From the Milky Way, the Initiative identified Voeld as Habitat 6, a "golden world" projected to be a life-sustaining and temperate garden world. This is confirmed by angaran historians: Voeld was once a heavily populated and thriving angaran colony. 
During the Scourge event, gravitational distortions affected Voeld's orbit. Models from the Nexus tech labs show how this triggered a minor ice age. The angara were forced to withdraw to a few urban centers, with the rest of Voeld's population scattered in smaller settlements. 
Voeld is therefore both culturally and strategically important to the angara, and has drawn the attention of the kett. Reports suggest a significant military presence on both sides, as the Angaran Resistance fight to defend Voeld's population and protect the ice-encased remains of their world.

Voeld Outpost Established[]
The Initiative's new outpost, Taerve Uni, has been safely established. Led by new mayor Priya Blake, Taerve Uni is committed to open borders with the angara as Voeld becomes more habitable. The outpost is now a major supplier of water ice to other colonies and the Nexus.

Voeld Vault Activated[]
Analyzing Suvi's orbital readings, it appears that the Voeld vault, unable to gravitationally compensate for Voeld's change in orbit, has triggered a controlled melt of frozen carbon dioxide in the permafrost. Projections show this will thicken the atmosphere, gradually raising Voeld's temperature to ease the ice age. This reveals that Remnant vaults are capable of sophisticated analysis and response to planetary conditions.

Anomaly[]
Architect Husk: Voeld[]
Note:  This anomaly is available after completing Missing Science Crew.
DATA:
Classification: Enemy (decommissioned)
Origin: Andromeda (Voeld)
ANALYSIS:
This Remnant Architect's programming directives have been interrupted. It is in an orbital standby mode and remains tethered to its home planet Voeld. From this clearer vantage point, obvious, subtle damage from repeated freeze-thaw cycles in a saturated environment. Many systems seem to be pinging for maintenance.

Environmental Information[]
Main article: Hazard
Voeld is an ice world with freezing levels of cold prior to activation of the planet's vault. All areas not heated or indoors pose an environmental hazard to personnel and vehicles.

SAFE CONDITION - TEMPERATURE -30.58°C
Hazard Level 1 - TEMPERATURE -41.87°C
Hazard Level 2 - TEMPERATURE -52.25°C
Unlike other planets, Voeld only has a partial reduction in Hazard Level once the vault is activated and not a complete removal of the Hazard Level.

Trivia[]
The planet's name is pronounced "Vold," rhyming with "cold." as shown by a line in a Forward Station readout called "Nexus Live-Link" which states '"Check it! Current temp: -60C. Baby, it's Voeld outside." [janethereveller]'. Its capital Estraaja is pronounced "Estray-ah", similar to "Australia", in an Australian accent.
Some pre-Scourge angaran cities on Voeld include Ja Niihk, Dallis, and Pahenaan. They are no longer inhabited, and only the ruins of Ja Niihk can be explored.
Voeld has a single moon, as can be seen rotating it on the 3D map in the Angaran Resistance Base.
