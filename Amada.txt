Prerequisite: Normandy Crash Site (Mass Effect 2)


Amada has two worlds of interest to xenoarchaeologists. The rest are inhospitable with moderate mineral wealth. However, because of alien influence in its distant past the system is a rare source of extractable element zero through Eingana.
The system was patrolled by the SSV Normandy in 2183 for geth activity, as three ships have been reported missing there in the past month. Instead of geth the Normandy encountered a Collector Cruiser and was subsequently destroyed. The remains crashed on Alchera, along with the body of Commander Shepard. Two years later, the revived Shepard may receive a transmission from Admiral Hackett directing them to the ship's final resting place to account for missing crew and to plant a monument to its memory.
