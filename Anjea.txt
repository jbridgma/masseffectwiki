Description[]
Anjea is a typical ammonia-methane ice giant. Traces of chlorine in the atmosphere give it a distinct green tint. Penetrating scans have revealed large numbers of hollow, unpowered objects with dimensions of 3.14 by 12.56 by 28.26 meters circulating in the equatorial cloud bands. These objects appear to have "sails" or "wings" attached, allowing them to be borne aloft by Anjea's winds. While they are too deep to be reached for study, popular conjecture in xenoarcheological circles holds that they are "coffins" of an ancient race who laid their dead to rest in the gas giant.

Trivia[]
The dimensions of the objects circulating Anjea hold the same proportions (1:4:9) as the Monolith from Arthur C. Clarke's Space Odyssey.
Anjea may be named after the goddess of fertility in the Australian Aboriginal pantheon.
