Description[]
Pathfinder hardsuits are heavily modified from the Initiative suit baseline, foregoing certain scientific instruments in favor of added combat capability. The role of a Pathfinder includes threat neutralization, and improved stabilizers and targeting controls help ensure they can protect his or her team.

At Ranks III & IV, the existing description changes to add the following text: "Upgraded suits incorporate new materials and technologies developed in the Heleus Cluster."
At Ranks V - X, the existing description changes to add the following text: "This custom suit incorporates defenses against technologies unique to Heleus Cluster species."
Types[]
Ranks I - X are named Pathfinder when the four armor pieces are crafted.
When the four armor pieces are found in-game:

Ranks I-II are named Pathfinder.
Ranks III-IV are named Pathfinder Scout.
Ranks V-X are named Pathfinder Vigilant.
Note:  There are no differences between the found versions compared to the crafted versions (other than visual).

Player Notes[]
Features[]
Rank I Arms, Helmet, and Legs armor pieces use Titanium for development while Ranks II - X use Platinum.
Strategies[]
Pathfinder armor favors weapon-based offense and powers/profile-based defenses. 
When used as a complete set, Pathfinder armor works best for playing styles favoring run-and-gun tactics, particularly with fast-firing weapons and powers emphasizing shield/barrier/armor boosts. Given that Ryder can build access to powerful profiles, Pathfinder armor allows Ryder to maximize the Sentinel and Explorer profiles to greater effect than other armors, as they incorporate similar bonuses. This frequently leads a to a gunslinger-style of combat, with the player able to effectively operate at mid-range with a variety of weapons, with enhanced durability or defenses to keep from staying in cover exclusively. 
While equipped, the armor helps to narrow the reticle spread of fast-firing weapons and is devastating when combined with the passive Combat skills to further reduce recoil. Given that there are weapons in each class already with rapid fire capabilities, notably the Indra sniper rifle, Soned heavy machine gun, and N7 Piranha shotgun in addition to all of the submachine gun pistols, and that any weapon can be modified for burst or rapid fire, gives the player a benefit at any range.
In terms of defense, the power restoration and defense bonuses synergize well with powers that recharge player stats, such as Annihilation Field's vampiric qualities or Energy Drain's shield sapping when it redirects into the player's.
The armor's main drawback is that it lacks any specific bonuses for power recharge or offensive boosts, both of which are useful in combo detonations. As a second drawback, the armor is also expensive to produce.
As with all of Ryder's armor, players can mix-and-match different armors for balancing traits, and using the crafting option can imbue the armor with other important features and bonuses.

Bugs[]
Pathfinder Chest Rank I is not able to be crafted, in game meaning if the player does not buy it from the Nexus armor vendor before reaching level 6 it is unobtainable. For the Task: Pathfinder Armor Crafting, the player can use any Rank of the Chest piece to complete the task.
Trivia[]
In prerelease footage, the Ryder Family Secrets, and Alec Ryder's entry in the codex, Ryder Senior's pathfinder armor has scarf while in the final game he does not.
The pathfinder chest's scarf isn't viewable while looking at it in the inventory
