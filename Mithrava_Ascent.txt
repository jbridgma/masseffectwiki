Mithrava Ascent is an enormous Remnant tower on Havarl. At its top lies Mithrava, an insular settlement of isolated angaran sages. The entrance to its entrance is at the southern end of the Chasm of the Builders, and the only way into the structure is through a bridge hanging over a "moat" crackling with lightning.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Traversing the tower is an arduous and dangerous affair, discouraging casual travel. Part of the difficulty is by design as the sages implemented security measures to protect their sanctuary. 
Pathfinder Ryder may only scale the structure after hearing of Havarl's ecological problems from Kiiran Dals: the path they take involves weaving in and around three levels of the tower through gravity wells, jumpjet-assisted climbing, occasional console interfacing to manipulate the terrain, and confronting various bots. 
Strewn about the structure are numerous supply caches and miscellaneous containers that may yield items of value.
