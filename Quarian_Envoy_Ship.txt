Location: Milky Way / Far Rim / Dholen


Description[]
This diplomatic frigate is like no quarian ship on record. Its hull is relatively low temperature and it appears to be venting heat in a manner similar to that of the Normandy when it comes out of stealth mode. How the quarians developed this high-tech vessel is unknown, but its hailing frequencies are open and welcoming messages are being tightbeamed to the Normandy.
