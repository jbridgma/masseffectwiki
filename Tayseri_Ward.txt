Tayseri Ward is a location on the Citadel. During the Eden Prime War, the Ward suffered extensive damage when the Reaper Sovereign exploded. One of the most impacted structures on the Ward was the Dilinaga Concert Hall. Two years later, technicians continue repairs on the damage inflicted by removing wreckage and restoring power to the ward. When asked by Commander Shepard about the damage caused by the destruction of Sovereign, Captain Bailey mentions this ward as an example of the worst done to the station.
According to a shuttle schedule seen in the Zakera Ward, other locations in the ward include a Museum of Galactic History, Auxua School of the Arts, Gaeron Botanical Gardens, and Tayseri Point. The station at the Dilinaga Concert Hall is closed for repairs.

Trivia[]
The Dilinaga Concert Hall may be named for Matriarch Dilinaga.
