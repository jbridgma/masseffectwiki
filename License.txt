An armory license will automatically allow the shipboard Alliance Requisition Officer to have access to supplies made by the company or manufacturer that owns the rights to the license. They can be purchased with credits from vendors across the galaxy.
Though his stock is random, the more licenses you own, the more varied his available items for purchase tend to be. It appears as though each license is allocated an amount of additional stock, and so even though more licenses are available, they do not detract from the chance of stock covered by a different manufacturer's license from appearing.
There are fourteen licenses in total, and all but two can be purchased from various merchants and vendors in the Citadel. Five licenses are available when you first begin a new game, an additional five become available at level 18, and the last four licenses become available at level 36. The Normandy Requisitions Officer already has access to Hahne-Kedar goods from the start, and unlocking the Rich achievement will give him access to Spectre - Master Gear at quality VII (leveling up to Level 50 will grant him access to the superior gear at quality X) on all further playthroughs, regardless if the character is new or not.
Note:  Purchased licenses do not carry through to any new characters created; you will have to re-purchase them each time you play.
