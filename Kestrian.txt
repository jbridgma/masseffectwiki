Kestrian is an exile who lives alone in one of the usually empty structures in Spirits' Ledge.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Kestrian had no interest joining the mutineers during the Nexus Uprising until his brother convinced him. His brother died in the revolt, and by the time Kestrian had a change of heart it was too late. Having settled on Kadara, he now keeps his head down and actively avoids siding with either the Outcasts nor the Collective, deeming it the best way to stay alive.
Pathfinder Ryder can question him about the planet's water toxicity, the local kett situation, and his opinion on the exile factions. Kestrian has heard rumors of disappearances and mishaps attributed to kett, and wonders if Sloane Kelly actually exterminated them all. If Ryder decisively sided with either Outcasts or Collective, Kestrian acknowledges there isn't actually any choice on which side to take, taking into consideration the fate of the respective factions' leaders.
Kestrian developed a cautious and world-weary attitude due to living with criminals in a hellhole, and he has resorted to scavenging from places like Kadara Slums for sustenance. His lair is a disorganized mess of hoarded items from medical kits to protein rations.
