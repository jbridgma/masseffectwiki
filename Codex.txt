This article is about the Codex for the original Mass Effect Trilogy. For the guide to collecting Codex entries in those games, see the Codex Entry Guide.Â For the Codex in Mass Effect: Andromeda, see Codex (Mass Effect: Andromeda).


The Codex is the focal point for background information within Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. In Mass Effect 3, the Codex is integrated into the Journal.
Please note: These entries are quoted verbatim from the game and should be kept pristine. Edits and updates should be placed on non-Codex pages relating to the same subject (e.g. don't update the Mako's Codex entry, update the Mako article instead). 
Please note: For Codex entries with an audio entry, if the audio entry differs from the text entry, then no action should be taken. Text entries are copied verbatim from the game regardless what the audio entry says. For example the text entry for the Thanix Cannon says "[t]he Thanix can fire reliably every five seconds", while the audio entry says, "[t]he Thanix can fire reliably every fifteen seconds". Even though there is a discrepancy between the text and audio entries, the text entry should reflect the text entry from the in-game Codex, not the audio entry.
