Description[]
Though exceptionally large for a terrestrial world, Imaneya is composed of water ice with a core of various carbonaceous compounds. It has a density only half that of Earth, and an atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon monoxide. The surface is composed of surprisingly pure water ice, with a high albedo.

Trivia[]
By "surprisingly pure water ice with a high albedo" we are to understand a composition like that of Enceladus, Bond albedo over 0.9 and geometric albedo over unity.
