Krogan Warriors are krogan that are tougher than ordinary krogan, and are usually armed with assault rifles and shotguns. They are differentiated from their lesser kin with their distinctive all-red armor.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Krogan Warriors are seen on a few planets where Saren Arterius has visited and are used to defend areas and to support allied geth forces. They are also deployed during the former Spectre's final assault on the Citadel.

Tactics[]
These warriors are tougher than their common counterparts and should be focused on first. Because they are armed with assault rifles, they will tend to usually stay at a distance, but will charge if they get the opportunity.
Using biotics against these enemies is recommended because they are vulnerable to those attacks. As with all krogan, if they aren't killed while in the air, or by ammunition/grenades that can destroy the enemy upon killing them (like incendiary, toxic, or high explosive), they will regenerate. Be sure to keep them in the air for as long as possible, or finish them with properly modified weapons to avoid this.
