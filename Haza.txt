Description[]
Haza, an ice giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, is colored a striking aquamarine because of small concentrations of methane, water ice, and ammonia. Its relatively small size is a curiosity to human astronomers, who would have expected a larger hydrogen-helium giant to have accreted during the solar system's formation.
The quarians have driven the geth away from the planet's helium-3 fueling machinery, but it is clear the geth put up a fight. Wreckage from quarian fighters litters the area, and more than one refueling station appears to have been blown apart by kinetic impacts in a scorched-earth tactic.
