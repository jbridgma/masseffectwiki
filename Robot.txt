Robots are mobile synthetic units. They are deployed by the batarian army on the Ahn'Kedar Orbital Platform to support their assault.

Tactics[]
Robots have a relatively strong health and shields bar while they can also inflict a good amount of damage. You should deal carefully with those.
Like others enemies in Mass Effect Galaxy, their shields will begin to regenerate 1.5 seconds after being disabled, but their health will not.
These robots can quickly move and will often try to flank you.
Trivia[]
They are similar to the Drones encountered in Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2.
