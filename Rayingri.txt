Description[]
Rayingri is a small, barren terrestrial world. While it possesses a reasonably temperate climate and number of useful resources, no mining corporation is willing to risk investment.
A rogue planetoid, dubbed Vahtz by the initial salarian surveyor team, entered the system approximately ten thousand years ago, and was trapped in a decaying orbit around Rayingri. It is nearing the end of its slow spiral inwards. Earthquakes and cyclonic windstorms are increasingly common on Rayingri.
Within a few hundred years, the planets will rip each other apart. Some asari travel consortiums have already announced sponsorship of cruises to observe the spectacle.

2

Initial

Crashed probe (salvage requires medium Electronics.)


3

Discovery

Scavenger corpses
“The burnt corpses – evidently a "mom and pop" independent salvage team – show signs of close range hits from geth heavy particle beams.”




4

Discovery

Abandoned camp (salvage unlocked crate.)
“The scavengers who made this camp are gone.  They seem to have abandoned it abruptly some time ago.”




5

Initial

Crashed escape pod (UNC: Locate Signs of Battle)
“This downed pod contains a League of One medallion.  Its owner is nowhere to be found.”

Viewed from the planet, the Gagarin sun appears to lie at the directional north, instead of west or east. From the Mako landing site, the planetoid Vahtz can be seen at the compass south.
