Description[]
Maganlis is a rock terrestrial with an atmosphere of sulphur dioxide and trace amounts of helium. Scans reveal ancient lava plains on the surface, implying a geologically active past. The crust consists of sulphur and basalts, but the planet's mass suggests a core of iron and heavier materials. Cursory drill coring suggests the possibility of simple subterranean life.

Survey Text[]

“While scanning the planet Maganlis, you discovered the remains of a damaged research vessel. Your recon team found no signs of survivors, but they did bring back a Rocam Outpost insignia.”


Assignments[]
Collection: UNC: Turian Insignias: Insignias ×1 (Rocam Outpost)
Properties[]
Albedo comes out to "-0.67". This planet should have an anti-greenhouse effect from the SO2. The planet is far too hot. Internal heating alone cannot account for this.
