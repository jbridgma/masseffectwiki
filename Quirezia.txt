Description[]
A typical hydrogen-helium gas giant, Quirezia serves as a naval resource for fuel-gathering and magnetic-field discharge. The planet is surrounded by a band of seven large moons that form The Necklace--a reference to a legendary jewel owned by the ancient asari queen for which Quirezia was named.
Quirezia's orbit places it within the system's frost line, where gas giants do not usually form. For this reason, the planet is believed to be an extrasolar capture. The alternative, that its orbit is decaying, is a horrifying prospect to the tourism and immigration boards of Nevos, since they would be in the gas giant's eventual path.
