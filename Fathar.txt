Fathar is a red dwarf star with three terrestrial worlds, two of which are habitable. Its two habitable worlds are rich in platinum, while the lifeless one has good amounts of iridium. 
Terminus warlords frequent the system for prey, and they have been most successful in demoralizing the miners of Korar: anybody expecting a child moves out of there due to a slave raid in 2047 CE that targeted all of the world's children. However, they have been less successful in taking Lorek from the batarians who in turn stole the planet from the asari in 1913 CE.
