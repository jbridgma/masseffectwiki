The Kadara Market's Mods Merchant typically sells weapon mods.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The mods merchant berates his asari smuggler supplier for being late, though the latter reasons she had to give Sloane Kelly her cut. Impatient, the merchant urges her to show him what she got. However, the smuggler doesn't have much anyway: Sloane took a big cut, and the Collective swiped the most of the rest. Resigned, the merchant's glad he doesn't have to pay protection fees anymore. Later though, the merchant praises the smuggler for bringing in a decent haul, and the asari quips that one man's junk is another's payday.
When Pathfinder Ryder first talks to him, the merchant compliments their gear but reckons they can find something better in his console. If Ryder asks if his supplies are stolen, the merchant deems the answer out of their price range. If Ryder simply wants a combat edge, the salarian assures him they'll need it on Kadara.
The merchant also sells miscellaneous items like snacks and OSDs of Last of the Legion, if Ryder endeavors to collect the necessary ingredients for the Movie Night aboard the Tempest.
