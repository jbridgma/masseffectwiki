Description[]
Rife with volcanic activity and scorched by the nearby orange star Nahuala, Agessia is an unforgiving and ever-shifting puzzle box of a planet. Ceaseless solar winds and magnetic bombardment have thinned Agessia's atmosphere, but these features are actually a boon in wartime. Powerful magnetic fields and large quantities of airborne volcanic ash make many forms of scanning difficult, allowing the asari to hide valuable palladium and molybdenum mines needed for the war effort. Agessia's sheltered underground colonies remain untouched by the Reapers, at least for the moment.
