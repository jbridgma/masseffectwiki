Description[]
Within three years, Promavess will slam into a neighboring planet, Sotera, and suffer an apocalyptic transformation. Asari explorers searching for life in Promavess's hydrocarbon morass were relieved to find none. Promavess's methane-ethane atmosphere is likely to ignite when it mingles with Sotera's oxygen, and both planets will shatter under the force of the collision.
