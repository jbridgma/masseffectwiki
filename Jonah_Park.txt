Jonah Park is an engineer working for the Andromeda Initiative outpost on New Tuchanka, provided Nakmor Morda allowed the creation of the outpost. He designs agricultural machinery that work best in arid conditions such as on Elaaden, and he's responsible for the installation and testing of the outpost's irrigation system.
The engineer keeps himself busy with volatile projects that he cautions Pathfinder Ryder to watch out lest they step onto landmines in his cluttered office. Asked if there are other bombshells to know about, Jonah warns Ryder to be wary of Boomerang as he isn't exactly right in the head. Jonah even requests Kariste Archana over comms to keep others away from his working space out of safety concerns.
Jonah mostly works with the krogan botanists of New Tuchanka to provide them what they need. He is persuaded that, with his help, krogan will be able to grow crops on the planet. He thinks highly of Vorn, calling him a genius ahead of his time while Jonah only does his best to keep up.
Alone in his office, Jonah can often be overheard muttering machinery-related problems to himself.
