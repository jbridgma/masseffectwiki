Marsh is a batarian merchant on Omega who owns and runs the Omega Market. He is having trouble competing with the black market, and is struggling to make a profit. His shop sells a variety of items, including Model Ships and weapon enhancements. He may have something in his wares for humans, but not much. If his customers walk away, he's confident they'll be back.







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




Shepard can obtain a discount from Marsh in one of two ways. Both entail pretending to walk away either by claiming to find better stuff elsewhere, or demeaning his prices as tourist bait. Marsh acknowledges the black market may be cheaper, but risky. If Shepard politely haggles, Marsh agrees to give the discount so long as it's only between the two of them. If Shepard rudely haggles, Marsh concedes giving the Commander the "uppity human discount" and nothing more.
