Description[]
A common, versatile, military-grade assault rifle. Accurate when fired in short bursts, and deadly when fired on full auto. The Avenger is effective at penetrating shields, armor, and biotic barriers.
The modular design and inexpensive components of the Avenger make it a favorite of military groups and mercenaries alike. The avenger [sic] has a reputation for being tough, reliable, easy to use, and easy to upgrade.
Manufactured by the Elkoss Combine.

Acquisition[]
This is the default assault rifle acquired during the Freedom's Progress mission at the beginning of the game, provided the player is a Soldier. This weapon can be acquired later on for other classes by accepting assault rifle specialization on the Collector Cruiser.

Squad Use[]
This weapon can be used by Garrus, Grunt, Legion, Samara/Morinth, and Zaeed. Squadmates deal 45% less damage than Shepard.

Player Notes[]
The Avenger's main drawback is its low damage per shot, as this forces the player to remain out of cover for longer than with weapons like the M-96 Mattock.
The Avenger is not very accurate at longer ranges but is fairly stable, with less recoil than the M-9 Tempest SMG but more recoil than the M-15 Vindicator Battle Rifle.
With fully automatic fire and the largest ammo capacity of any assault rifle except the M-76 Revenant, the Avenger can be a decent weapon for protracted fights against large numbers of weaker enemies.
The Assault Rifle Accuracy (Targeting VI) upgrade reduces the bullet spread, making the Avenger more effective at medium ranges.
Before researching Assault Rifle Accuracy, the most accurate way to fire is to repeatedly press and release the trigger. This minimizes crosshair spread and muzzle climb.

Description[]
The Avenger is a common, versatile, military-grade assault rifle manufactured by the Elkoss Combine. It's accurate when fired in short bursts, and deadly when fired on full auto. The modular design and inexpensive components of the Avenger make it a favorite of military groups and mercenaries alike. The rifle has a reputation for being tough, reliable, easy to use, and easy to upgrade.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
The M-8 Avenger can be found during Prologue: Earth, next to the radio. Shepard picks it up in a cutscene if the player does not do so.

Multiplayer
The M-8 Avenger is one of the five starter weapons. Upgrades are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The Avenger is categorized as common.

Player Notes[]
The Avenger deals low damage but is very light especially at higher levels, making it passable for a power-focused character.
The Avenger's standout features aside from low weight are a decent rate of fire, a large amount of spare ammunition, moderate accuracy, and a relatively fast reload. However, as one of the default starting weapons in both single-player and multiplayer, it is fairly weak in general and should be ditched in favor of alternatives as soon as they become available.

Description[]
A common and versatile assault rifle. The M-8 Avenger's modular design and inexpensive components made it a favorite of military groups and mercenaries in the Milky Way. Many Avengers were acquired for Andromeda Initiative security forces. The sturdy rifle has a reputation for being reliable and easy to use.

Features[]
The S variant features boosted damage, clip size, rate of fire, and max ammo compared to the regular multiplayer Avenger. Most of these were tweaked in the final multiplayer update. Reload time also decreased from 1.5 seconds to 1.4 seconds.
Previous balance changes mostly increased the S variant's damage, with one update changing the base weapon's damage.

Trivia[]
Many cutscenes show Shepard and other squad members using the Avenger, even if they don't have it equipped in-game.
Weapons Lockers show an Avenger picture as their icon.
The appearance is based on the default Hahne-Kedar Lancer assault rifle in Mass Effect – the original Elkoss Combine "Avenger" rifle had the same 3D model but a red texture without the M8 markings.
The side of the rifle's scope is emblazoned with the words "Hard Lock." One place where it is easy to see this is at the end of Mass Effect 2, when Joker is providing covering fire, shooting down the Collector infantry.
The N7 Valkyrie is a variant of the Avenger.
Like the Mattock and Vindicator, the Avenger's integrated scope was removed from its model in Mass Effect 3, likely to avoid looking redundant if the player adds a scope mod. This is a purely visual difference and has no gameplay effect.
There are two versions of the Avenger seen in Mass Effect 3: one similar in appearance to its previous incarnation, carried by NPCs, and one without the built-in scope, carried by Shepard and the squad.
In Mass Effect Galaxy, Jacob Taylor is using a variant of the M-8 Avenger with no heat mechanism or thermal clips.
