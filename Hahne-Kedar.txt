Reliable and efficient, Earth-based Hahne-Kedar has become a major supplier to the Systems Alliance military. Their weapons are considered stock quality at best, though their armor lines are generally recognized as above average. 
It has at least one known subsidiary organisation, the Hahne-Kedar Shadow Works.
Shepard begins Mass Effect with an armory license for Hahne-Kedar.

Mass Effect: Revelation[]
Because the corporation's weapons are standard issue to Alliance troops, Kahlee Sanders, in Mass Effect: Revelation, identifies an imposter posing as a Alliance military security officer who tries to arrest her on Elysium through the pistol he is carrying, which is not a Hahne-Kedar model.

Weapons[]
Due to using reverse-engineered technology, Hahne-Kedar weapons all have a lower damage output than other manufacturers.[1]

Armor[]
Hahne-Kedar produces the following armors for humans, krogan, and turians: Mantis Armor, Predator Armor, Scorpion Armor, and Ursa Armor. A fifth armor line, the Silverback Armor, is manufactured for the exclusive use of the turians. The use of a field destabilizer across all Hahne-Kedar lines of armor produces increased shield efficiency when compared with most other armors.[2]

Trivia[]
Hahne-Kedar, being a dual name company with the initials read as "H-K" when shortened, may be a reference to German weapons manufacturer Heckler & Koch, also known as "H&K", who design and produce a variety of weaponry for military and law enforcement. It may also refer to HK-47, the assassin droid from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic game.
In the first game, Hahne-Kedar's armors of the same weight and rank class have no differences in statistics compared to each other. The only difference between them is their aesthetic appearances.
The Official Game Guide erroneously states that the Mantis Armor can be worn by the quarians, and misspells the corporation's name as Hahne-Kadar.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 45: Reverse Engineered gives -20% to Damage, which is correct when compared to baseline stats.
