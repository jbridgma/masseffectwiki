The Horse Head Nebula has a motley of uninhabited and barely-surveyed planets with some prospect for resourcing. Despite its inclusion in Earth Systems Alliance Space and proximity to Citadel Space, it is situated in a legal grey area for Citadel races: Noveria, at least, is not part of Citadel Space.
Cerberus is known to have major operations in the cluster. In 2185, the Minuteman Station is known to be located somewhere in the nebula. In 2186, the organization's headquarters and at least one outpost are in relatively out-of-the-way positions within the nebula.

Trivia[]
The Horse Head Nebula (also known as Barnard 33 in bright nebula IC 434) takes its name from the horse head shape in its middle. The first human to discover it was  Williamina Fleming in 1888 at Harvard University.
Although Mass Effect spells the nebula's name "Horse Head Nebula", in Mass Effect 3, the same celestial object is presented as "Horsehead Nebula", without the space. The latter is the correct terminology applied to the realworld counterpart.
Although the Minuteman Station is featured at the beginning of Mass Effect 2, the cluster and the station are no longer accessible after gaining the Normandy SR-2.
