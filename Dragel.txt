Description[]
The tiny rock planet Dragel is notable for its status as a strategic reserve of heavy metals. It has been warmed slightly by a thin atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon monoxide, but otherwise remains hostile to life. In the clandestine fashion typical of salarians, a military outpost orbits the planet but does not appear on Alliance star maps.
Like Saradril, Dragel is named for the matrilineal clan that sent the first manned mission to the planet’s surface. However, a thriving minority from the Sylar Clan, who sent the first manned mission to orbit the planet, insists to this day that their landing attempt was sabotaged by the Dragels and the planet should bear their name. Relations between the two clans remain tense.
