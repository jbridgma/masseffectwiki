Description[]
Medokos is a medium-size gas giant. Although its mass exceeds that of Jupiter, the planet is somewhat denser and thus smaller. A large number of moons, plantesimals, and other detritus orbits Medokos, as its gravitational pull has "cleared the neighborhood" of material that might otherwise form an asteroid belt.
