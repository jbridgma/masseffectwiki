General Content[]
This downloadable content is available to all Mass Effect 2 players for purchase or download. If Mass Effect 2 was purchased outside of Origin, you could purchase DLC content from BioWare's website (After BioWare's website shut down, all DLC for Mass Effect 2 became available to download on EA's Website for the PC. Due to the requirement of logging into the Cerberus Network with an EA account with any DLC purchased under it, simply downloading these will not give them to you automatically, because of which, EA made a DLC bundle available for purchase on Origin.).
