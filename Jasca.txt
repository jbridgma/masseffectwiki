Jasca is an injured angara writhing in an infirmary on Techiix.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Having heard of Pathfinder Ryder's abilities with the Remnant, Jasca asks them to "talk" with the Remnant so the machines will leave him alone. He used to dig for useful tech around Remnant pillars, with the bots ignoring him for the most part. However, the machines chased him off during his last excursion, and he was injured slipping on the ice.
If Ryder clears up the misconceptions by explaining they can't actually talk with the machines, Jasca disdainfully questions their usefulness to him. If Ryder instead advises staying away from Remnant territory, Jasca dislikes being safe but poor: he doesn't eat if he doesn't earn anything from his digs. Either way he "thanks" the Pathfinder for nothing, grumbling about the Remnant ruining his business. 
A medical readout in front of his bed reveals that he has a compromised immune system due to taon overexertion and he actually has a respiratory illness.
