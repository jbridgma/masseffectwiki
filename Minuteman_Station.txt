Minuteman Station is an orbital facility operated by the human black-ops network Cerberus, located in the Horse Head Nebula. 

Mass Effect: Foundation[]
Miranda Lawson operated on this base at some point during Commander Shepard's reconstruction. This facility housed some of the Lazarus Project's material: research, laboratories, Shepard's body, and the Commander's backup clone.

Mass Effect 2[]
This station is where Commander Shepard arrives at after escaping the Lazarus Research Station, to meet with the Illusive Man. It is also where the Normandy SR-2 first launches under Shepard's command.

Trivia[]
A minuteman was a member of the organized New England colonial militia companies during the American Revolutionary War, so named because of their ability to mobilize to battle readiness in a short period of time.
