Hermia is the asari merchant running the Serrice Technology kiosk on Illium.







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




If Gianna Parasini survived in 2183, she is on Illium investigating Hermia for smuggling schematics from Noveria. Commander Shepard can help Gianna by exposing Hermia, causing Hermia to flee, saying she needs to contact her lawyer. On the other hand, if Shepard informs her of Gianna's investigation, Hermia will go into hiding and gives Shepard a discount. The discount is the same if Shepard charms or intimidates her to negotiate prices.
