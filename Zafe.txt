Description[]
Zafe is a relatively small hydrogen and helium gas giant. There are several tenuous belts of debris in equatorial orbit. Spectral analysis of the material suggests artificial origin, perhaps the remains of stations that once mined Zafe for helium-3.

Trivia[]
Zafe is too small to be a "hydrogen and helium gas giant" (William Hubbard, The New Solar System 4th ed, 1999; p. 194). It is more likely a dense "ice giant" like Neptune or Gliese 436 b.
