Strategies
The Rank 4 upgrade decision depends largely on where Ryder wants to be relative to Cora Harper in combat.
If Ryder favors Vanguard Profile or close-range Sentinel Profile styles of gameplay, then "Restoration" would be of greater benefit.
If Ryder prefers to hang back letting Cora take the front-line, then "Radius" would be the better fit. This upgrade allows Ryder and the squad to stay further apart while still getting the benefit of the upgrade.
The Rank 6 "Regeneration" upgrade is very handy in prolonged fights against heavy enemy attacks, with the health regeneration stacking with any health-regen upgrades Ryder and team have.
With the Rank 6 Regeneration upgrade, Cora can revive the third member of the squad if he or she is KO'd.
