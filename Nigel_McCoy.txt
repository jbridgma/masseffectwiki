Nigel McCoy is a colonist aboard the Hyperion. He traveled from the Milky Way with his younger brother, Dash, who was aboard the Nexus. The brothers possessed matching pendants, and Nigel got his from their father.
Following the Hyperion's rendezvous with the Nexus, Nigel was brought out of cryostasis. He then received word that Dash was killed during a failed attempt to setup an outpost on the planet Eos. Heartbroken, he sought to unite his pendant with his brother's, vowing to do everything he can in Dash's memory going forward.
If Pathfinder Ryder hears about his travails in the Cryo Bay, Nigel asks them to take his pendant to a specific location on Eos, a place overlooking Site 1: Promise where he heard Dash used to go to think. While the task is still pending Nigel can be overheard muttering to himself that he'll make things right with his brother.
Once the pendants have been reunited, Nigel sends the Pathfinder an email expressing gratitude and plans for the future. When he and his wife settle down and start a family, he wants to name his firstborn Dash in honor of his brother and best friend, hoping his child will also become his new best friend.
