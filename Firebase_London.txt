Firebase London offers some of the best sniping opportunities of any map. Several long narrow map sections and overlooks with clear fields of fire make long range weapons very handy. However, long range enemies (like Nemeses and Geth Rocket Troopers) also benefit from these features and become much more troublesome.
The extraction point is perhaps one of the easier ones to hold by hunkering down. It is at the end of a section with limited access and good cover.
Though the Pedway makes for a great position to attack far-off enemies, be careful not to let yourself get flanked by troops closing from the stairwells, as well as Jetpack-equipped enemies jumping up to the middle of the overlook.
