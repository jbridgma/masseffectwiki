Description[]
A remote rock planet capped in ice, Shir has been exploited by Arvunan corporations for its minerals. Home to gold veins, which is used in spaceship shielding as well as jewelry, and cobalt deposits, used in high-tensile alloys, Shir shows no signs of being exhausted any time soon. A light gravity helps keep the planetary exportation process cheap.
