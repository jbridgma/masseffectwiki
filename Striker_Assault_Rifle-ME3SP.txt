The Striker Assault Rifle is an assault rifle in Mass Effect 3.

Description[]
The Striker is a fully-automatic weapon that functions more as a grenade launcher than a rifle, firing high-impact slugs that detonate on contact. The weapon increases its rate of fire the longer the trigger is held, which is devastating if the weapon can be kept on-target. In an attempt to market the Striker outside of the Krogan DMZ, the gun was designed to be fired by non-krogan, but its recoil tends to off-balance smaller species. Enthusiasts point out that the target on the receiving end of a Striker has far worse things to worry about than its shooter's balance.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
The Striker Assault Rifle is available after downloading the Mass Effect 3: Groundside Resistance Pack.
In the Legendary Edition it is available from the Elkoss Combine Arsenal Supplies terminal in the Presidium Commons for a base amount of 10,000 credits.

Multiplayer
Weapons are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The Striker Assault Rifle is categorized as rare and requires the Mass Effect 3: Resurgence Pack.

Player Notes[]
GeneralSingle-playerMultiplayer 
General
As the in-game description states, the Striker's rate of fire increases with continuous, uninterrupted fire.
As the trigger is held down to increase the rate of fire, the recoil also increases dramatically, making the Striker one of the hardest weapons to aim and control. Firing from cover improves both the Striker's accuracy and stability.
The high rate of fire will rapidly deplete reserve ammo. Adding an Assault Rifle Magazine Upgrade mod will somewhat alleviate this problem, as well as maximizing the potential amount of time the Striker can be fired at top speed.
Adding the Assault Rifle Stability Damper drastically decreases the kickback of the gun, making it easier to control. This upgrade does not alleviate the movement-impeding effects of firing the weapon, which slows Shepard as well as most multiplayer classes.
Due to the Striker's rounds being explosive, they will often deal damage to multiple enemies close to the primary impact point.
Weapon mods or ammo bonuses that increase penetration are useless; also, it is impossible to deal bonus damage to heads or enemy weak points.
As with most other weapons that fire explosive or unconventional projectiles, the Striker's grenades suffer no damage penalty from striking enemy armor (though they can sometimes be blocked by armor plating); the Striker possesses the damage and rate of fire to be effective against even heavy armored targets such as Brutes.
If you find it difficult to hit your target, it can be an effective strategy to aim at the ground near them. Like the M-37 Falcon and the Krysae Sniper Rifle, the Striker's grenades have a proximity fuse, enabling them to "airburst" if fired near enough to a target. These techniques can be used to effectively take out Guardians and CAT6 Heavies, or targets hiding around corners or behind cover.
This weapon will stun unshielded non-heavy units. This is a weaker stun effect compared with the M-37 Falcon, Adas Anti-Synthetic Rifle, and even the Scorpion heavy pistol, which can all stun shielded and even heavy armored units. However, the Striker has a higher rate of fire and damage output than the aforementioned options.
As with most weapons that gain damage or firing rate increases from sustained fire, anything that can stun the wielder can hinder the Striker's maximum damage potential.
Like with the Adas Anti-Synthetic Rifle, activating Tactical Cloak after starting to fire the Striker on full auto (holding the trigger down) will not break cloak. By pairing this with an Assault Rifle Magazine Upgrade you can get many shots off while cloaked before having to reload. Use caution, however, as enemies can detect you while firing.
Adrenaline Rush can be used very effectively with this weapon, especially with an Assault Rifle Magazine Upgrade mod. This can allow you to push out up to 42 grenades before needing to reload, making this weapon extremely capable of dealing with groups of enemies.
Disruptor, cryo, and incendiary ammo augmentations can make the Striker very effective. The large number of grenades that the Striker can push out in a short space of time can apply the ammo effects to multiple targets quickly, also priming many for Power Combos.
This weapon is also very effective against Phantoms. Six or so shots near the a Phantom can very quickly bring down their barriers. As the Phantom turns invisible, shoot at the ground near them; it should quickly kill them or stun them and leave them with very low health to allow teammates to finish them off.
Single-player
While the Striker can be fired even at full auto on the move, firing even a single shot will briefly but significantly slow Shepard's movement.
Squadmates do not appear to suffer any movement penalty from firing the Striker; unfortunately, they also don't fire more than a few shots with it at a time and don't take full advantage of its maximum firing rate. The Striker is still a fairly effective weapon for squadmates as they don't suffer from the high recoil of the weapon, and the area damage and stunning effects provide valuable suppression.
Multiplayer
Firing the Striker slows most classes in multiplayer. Drell and vorcha classes are slowed the most; turians are moderately slowed; krogan and batarian classes are only marginally slowed. The Geth Juggernaut Soldier, Krogan Warlord Sentinel, N7 Destroyer Soldier, and all volus classes are exempt from the movement penalty.
Batarian Soldiers and Batarian Sentinels can wield this weapon very effectively: the Batarian Enforcer passive class power can also grant them extra spare ammo.
The Turian Ghost Infiltrator, with his passive class Armiger Legion stability bonuses and increased assault rifle damage in rank 6 Tactical Cloak, also wields this weapon exceptionally well.
Stun resistant or resilient classes like the Geth Juggernaut Soldier, N7 Destroyer Soldier, and the Krogan Warlord can exploit the Striker's maximum firing rate reliably.
The N7 Destroyer Soldier can fire the Striker at its maximum rate longer than other classes thanks to the magazine size bonus from Devastator Mode.
The N7 Demolisher Engineer can compensate for the Striker's high ammunition expenditure with its Supply Pylon.
Note that when lagging, the projectiles have a tendency to detonate at the shooters face, doing little-to-no damage to the enemy unless the enemy was at point blank range
You should also consider using the Barrage Upgrade in your Gear slot as it works very well with this weapon.
Stabilization Modules are also handy to reduce recoil.
