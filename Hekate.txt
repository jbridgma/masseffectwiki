Hekate is a gateway system. However, geth have been encountered here, so the Systems Alliance put out bulletins declaring all civilian traffic prohibited.
The system's worlds have moderate to rich resources, even if initial prospects found little by way of precious metals. Bothros, in particular, used to have a spacefaring civilization, and all that's left of them are archaeological remains and element zero.
Its three terrestrial worlds are all settled, or used to be settled, though living on them comes with some life-support caveats. Humans and asari live on Asteria while batarian criminals build safehouses on Ker. The system appears to have been initially surveyed by the asari; Triodia's moons are named from their virtues.
