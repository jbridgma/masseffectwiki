This article is about loyalty missions in Mass Effect: Andromeda. For loyalty in Mass Effect 2, see Loyalty.

Loyalty Missions are missions that expand the full potential of Pathfinder Ryder's squadmates in Mass Effect: Andromeda.

Overview[]
Mass Effect: Andromeda follows prior Mass Effect games in restricting the full potential of squadmates until Ryder attains the loyalty of a squadmate. 

All Rank 6 Skills for each squadmate are locked until the appropriate loyalty mission is completed.
Each loyalty mission is character specific.
Some loyalty missions are part of a mission arc. Only the final mission in the mission arc awards the Rank 6 skills. (Refer to the specific mission page for details).
