A salarian scientist needs a preserved kakliosaur specimen to help the krogan fight on toxic worlds. Find one and return it to him in the Presidium Commons.
Alternative journal entry:
A kakliosaur preserved in amber has been discovered. Find someone, anyone, on the Citadel who can use it.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II

Prerequisite: Priority: Geth Dreadnought

Listen to the salarian talking at the Apartments of the Presidium Commons. He is standing outside of Apartment 90, discussing how the krogan would benefit if they had the currently extinct kakliosaurs to aid them in battle.
If you never listened on his comm conversation, the mission objective and journal entry are obtained during a Search and Rescue operation in Argos Rho.

Walkthrough[]

The Argos Rho cluster only becomes available after the Geth Dreadnought's destruction over Rannoch. Scan the planet Intai'sei in the Phoenix system of the said cluster. After gaining the artifact (a kakliosaur skull), speak to the salarian War Strategist, who's still standing outside the apartment. He quips that kakliosaur DNA is remarkably pliable and the cloning facilities on Sur'Kesh should have battle-ready units produced quickly.
Completion of the mission gives you 5 Reputation, 15,000 credits, and updates the Krogan Clans War Asset. Further eavesdropping on salarian indicates that the krogan have already begun riding the kakliosaurs into battle and don't mind how the creatures mark their territory.
