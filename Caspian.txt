Caspian is an uninhabited system centered around an energetic young blue star. Its planets have few noteworthy resources overall, but several mineral deposits exist that can be prospected by the SSV Normandy. Almarcrux is a terraforming candidate, although the presence of primitive life there sparks some opposition from eco-ethics groups.
