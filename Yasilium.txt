Description[]
Yasilium is a minor rock planet that has not quite cleared the ring of debris at the edge of Loropi's orbits. It is believed to be an extrasolar capture. For several centuries, Yasilium supported a succession of mining colonies--first iridium, then titanium, and finally light metals like bauxite and alumina. The planet was abandoned long before the Reaper invasion.
