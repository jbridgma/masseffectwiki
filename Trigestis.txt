Description[]
Trigestis is a gas giant, named for the first salarian astronomer to predict planets' occurrences mathematically rather than through direct observation. It has a faint ring system and three moons: Sidacha, Norem, and Bestia. High-altitude clouds can be seen casting shadows on Trigestis' lower atmosphere, where concentrations of methane and ammonia give it an azure color. The planet is believed to be an extrasolar capture.
