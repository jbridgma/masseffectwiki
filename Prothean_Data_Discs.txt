Research on Prothean culture is focused on the discovery of ancient data discs.

Acquisition[]

“You've discovered one of the sought after data discs. Keep searching until you've collected them all.”


This assignment is initiated upon the discovery of a Prothean data disc anywhere in the galaxy. There are ten discs in total, but only 7 must be collected to pass the assignment.
Upon completion the assignment summary will read: "You've discovered a complete collection of asari artifacts.", but this is most likely just a typing error. This has been fixed in Mass Effect Legendary Edition and reads "Prothean" instead of "asari."

Background[]
These discs are extremely fragile; intact discs are rare and usually found inside Prothean data recording devices. Scientists have not yet found a way to transcribe the information from these discs, but it is generally agreed that they are the most promising source of information on Prothean science and culture.
