Player Notes[]
The Blast evolution of Biotic Protector is a useful fallback for Nyreen if she is overwhelmed by enemies. The blast is able to detonate all four types of Power Combos.
Biotic Protector can allow Nyreen to be used to distract enemies, particularly those such as Phantoms, Adjutants and Rampart Mechs that close in to their targets.
Biotic Protector does not start recharging until the invulnerability bubble ends. The Bonus Power evolution is therefore quite useful if you want Nyreen to benefit from Biotic Protector and maintain its powerful rank 6 buffs as often as possible while still being able to call on her Incinerate or Overload.
Nyreen can't activate Biotic Protector if she's stunned, so don't wait until enemies like Rampart Mechs close to melee range to order her to activate it.
