Description[]
Welm Urun is a hydrogen-helium gas giant. The phrase "Welm Urun" in the volus native language translates to "the golden one," a reference to its deep yellow-orange rings. Much to prospectors' dismay, there was no gold to be found in its moons. Welm Urun's economic contributions to the system was the ubiquitous helium-3, but the collection materials have since been destroyed by the Reapers.
