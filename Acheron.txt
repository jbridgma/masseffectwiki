Acheron is a poorly-explored inhospitable system consisting of four terrestrial worlds, one of which is tidally locked and another that is actually a double-planet body. Prospecting has identified several resources of note, though no organizations or business interests are rushing to lay claim to them.
The system was the site of a battle during the turians' Unification War in their early history.
