Firebase Sandstorm is a map in Mass Effect: Andromeda's multiplayer mode. Battered by searing heat, Firebase Sandstorm is a vital asset to APEX.
Description[]
Researchers at this sweltering outpost develop strategies and equipment to mitigate the desert's damaging effects on armor, weapons, and shuttles. Their collected data would provide a valuable strategic advantage to anyone operating in the searing heat and coarse sand of the Heleus Cluster's desert worlds.
