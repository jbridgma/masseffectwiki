Aquila is a gateway system. Elcor interests have a stake in the system due to Volturno being a prospective colonization effort. Vecchio had evidence of civilization, but questions abound as to how people lived on that inhospitable world.
The system's gas giants have poor mineral wealth while the terrestrial planets have above-average resources.
