Medic is a specialization class for Engineers and Sentinels, with the alternate specialization options being the Operative and the Bastion respectively. Medics improve upon the First Aid and Medicine talents and dramatically increase the recharge rate of associated abilities.

Overview[]
See also: Talents#Specialization Classes
Medics are most notable for their ability to use First Aid to revive fallen NPC squad members in combat, one of the only ways to do this in the game other than investing in the Spectre Training talent to unlock Unity, which generally requires a large investment of points to be anywhere as effective for this purpose as a Medic using medi-gel. Medic players can therefore forego Spectre Training if they choose, saving points to invest into other talents. Medic training also allows First Aid to ignore toxic damage, largely making the need to increase the squad's toxin resistance in any way no longer a concern.
