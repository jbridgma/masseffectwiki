Player Notes[]
Picking the "Guardian" specialization gives the Sentinel the fastest potential power recharge times of any class. This is especially useful for reactivating Tech Armor as fast as possible if it goes down.
Picking the "Raider" specialization combined with the "Power Armor" level 4 upgrade for Tech Armor gives the Sentinel the highest potential power damage bonus of any class as long as Tech Armor remains active.
