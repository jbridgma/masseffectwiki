An asari consortium, the Serrice Council is the creator of the most powerful bio-amp on the market. Not just concerned with profit, they typically make customers undergo a rigorous screening process before being approved to purchase their products. Serrice Council amps are incredibly rare—and highly prized—items on the galactic market.
The Serrice Council manufactures the highest quality omni-tools and bio-amps, with their Phantom Armor featuring the best biotic / tech protection available.
A licence for Serrice Council products can be purchased from Delan on the Citadel and potentially Commander Rentola on Virmire for a cost of 30,000 credits. 
Note:  The armory license for the Serrice Council is actually spelled "Serris Council" in the original Mass Effect release. This was fixed in Mass Effect Legendary Edition.

Trivia[]
The Mass Effect official guide by Prima mentions another omni-tool made by Serrice Council called Deepsnow Tool which cannot be found in the game.
References[]

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 50: Serrice Council's Asari Materials give +20% to DP and +40% to Shields and Hardening. When compared to baseline stats, only the Shields calculations appear precisely correct, though clear increases can be observed in the other two.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 50: Serrice Council's Advanced VI gives +20 to both Shields and Tech Cooldown Time (both mistakenly shown as +20%) and +10 to Medical (mistakenly shown as +10%). All calculations match in comparison to baseline stats.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 50: Serrice Council's Neural Parallelism gives +20 to Duration and Power (both mistakenly shown as +20%) and an alleged +20(%) to Cooldown, which appears to be +10 after observation. Otherwise, calculations for Duration and Power appear correct in comparison to baseline stats.
