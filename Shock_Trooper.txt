This article is about the class specialization in the first game. For the Mass Effect 2 Combat Mastery evolution, see Combat Mastery. For the geth unit, see Geth Shock Trooper.

The Shock Trooper is one of the two specialization classes for Vanguards and Soldiers, with the alternate specialization options being the Nemesis and the Commando, respectively. Highly trained killing machines, Shock Troopers excel in all combat situations.

Shock Troopers sport increased health and protection. Soldier Shock Troopers favor purely defensive bonuses and thus specialize in Immunity.
