Description[]
Xanadu's atmosphere is composed of methane and argon, while the planet's frozen surface is largely potassium with deposits of calcium. Its location in the deep cold of the outer system and its lack of valuable resources leave little to recommend it.

Trivia[]
Xanadu was the capital city of the Mongol conqueror Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty in what is now China. After the Venetian explorer Marco Polo visited the city in 1275 it came to be used as a metaphor for opulence.
