Player Notes[]
The Rank 4 Damage bonus boosts both weapon and power damage and is generally the better choice.  The Force upgrade boosts the knockback effects of Charge, Nova, and Shockwave which is handy if you use those powers more for crowd control than damage, but they perform that function more than adequately against the vast majority of enemies even without picking this evolution.
Rank 5 presents a dilemma, as a squad-wide boost to both weapons and powers is by no means weak.  However a weight capacity increase of 100% is something can't be obtained in any other way and is usually necessary if you want to carry the heavier shotguns or other weapons without crippling your ability to use Charge whenever you need it. If you don't plan on taking anything heavier than an SMG or pistol, then the Squad Bonus becomes much more appealing.  On higher difficulties however, it becomes increasingly difficult for Shepard to take out the toughest enemy types with only light weapons and powers.
The Rank 5 Squad Bonus evolution applies only to NPC squad members and not to Shepard. There is possibility for confusion, as the similarly named "Squad Bonus" evolutions of squadmates' class powers apply to the entire party including Shepard and also the owner of the power.
Rank 6 is dependent on what your core strategy is.  If you rely on Charge and Nova as your main sources of damage, then Power Intensity is the clear choice.  If you rely on a shotgun as your primary damage, then a 15% bonus is a dramatic improvement.  In general, especially on higher difficulties, taking out hard targets such as Brutes and Banshees with Charge isn't very practical (or safe), and shotgun damage is therefore the better choice, especially since weapons like the Venom are some of the best guns in the game for taking such targets out.  In addition, on higher difficulties power combos deal increasing damage, so as long as you're adept at setting up and detonating biotic explosions and other types of combos with your powers the raw damage and force of Charge and Nova is less important (note that combo damage is not increased by power evolutions unless specifically stated).  Finally, remember to consider what your Rank 5 evolution of Charge is as well so you're synergizing your weapon and power bonuses efficiently.
