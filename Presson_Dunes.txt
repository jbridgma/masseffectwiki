The Presson Dunes dominates the area west to northwest of Prodromos. Numerous T-shaped kett generators dot the landscape, which appear to be siphoning off bluish-green gas that's abundant near the cliffs and crannies of the region. 
There are also a few kett bunkers and barracks here. The aforementioned structures, plus the base at The Sheartop nearby, may lead Pathfinder Ryder to conclude the kett have built a stronghold on the planet. Wildlife in the region include taurgs and spitbugs, though occasionally some fiends may behave like wildlife as well and attack anything within range, including fellow kett.
According to Grace Lito, naming it "Presson Dunes" was August Bradley's idea: "Because [they] have to press on."
