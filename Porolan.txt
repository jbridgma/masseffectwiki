Description[]
Porolan is an enormous terrestrial planet, half again the size of Earth. Despite its thick atmopshere, the weak output of the red dwarf Macedon leaves its surface biting cold. The crust is mainly composed of silica, but significant deposits of iron and other industrial metals are present. These lodes may prove rich enough to be profitably mined despite the heavy gravity.

Survey Text[]
