Doctor Droyas is a krogan researcher working at Saren Arterius' base on Virmire.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




He is furious when Commander Shepard's squad breaks into his lab during their assault on the base; he claims that his work on the genophage is the "glorious salvation" of his species. Droyas works alongside an asari assistant and appears to be conducting research involving husks, though there is a variety of machines in his lab.

Tactics[]
Droyas is somewhat easier to defeat than other krogan enemies because he isn't wearing armor, and he also does not have regeneration or Immunity like other krogan.
Droyas possesses Neural Shock, making him very dangerous as he can stun you instantly, leaving you easy prey for the husk test subjects that attack you. Preemptively disable him to prevent this.
Strangely, while Droyas can charge at you, he does not possess any actual melee attacks, meaning he just gets into your face but isn't actually going to maul you as most krogan enemies would. The real threat comes from his large collection of tech abilities, which includes not only Neural Shock but also Overload, Sabotage, and Damping.
Droyas also possesses a form of First Aid where he activates his omni-tool and heals a small portion of his health.

Cut Content[]
An unused dialogue would have allowed Shepard (and Wrex, if present) to converse shortly with Droyas before he attacks, in which he defends his work to counter the genophage. In the final game, he attacks immediately while voicing one or two lines from this dialogue.[1]
