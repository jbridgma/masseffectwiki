Varren's Scalp is a valley in Kadara's badlands. It is bounded by the Sulfur Springs to the west, Haarfel to the east and north, and the mountain range hosting Kadara Port to the south.
Varren's Scalp is home to a wind farm that supplies power to Kadara Port and the local area. However, scavengers keep raiding the farm for parts. There are two Outlaw encampments in the area—one on the east end and one on the west end—plus a Remnant site near the Outlaw camp on the west.

New entry: The krogan, Rotan, thinks someone here is giving scavengers information on when to attack. Ridiculous excuse for his laziness. Don't know why we pay him.

Re: Patrol Schedule
Please, K. I don't want to do this anymore. People are getting suspicious.
