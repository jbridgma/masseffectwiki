Description[]
A hydrogen-helium gas giant, Veltman is home to the koshiroten, enormous storm cells that appear as whitish spots and are visible as far away as Bekenstein. As with most other colonized gas giants, Veltman's orbital space sports a variety of helium-3 refueling stations for merchant vessels. Of particular note among the orbital stations is the Dynamis Corporation's facility for manufacturing metastable metallic hydrogen, despite the risks involved in manipulating the powerful mass effect fields needed to do so. Citadel warships, which use the substance in their thrusters, can frequently be seen docking at Veltman as a result. This makes the Boltzmann system one of the most heavily patrolled in Citadel space.

Trivia[]
The planet is likely named after Martinus J. G. Veltman, a Dutch theoretical physicist and winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with his student, Gerardus 't Hooft.
