The Technician is encountered during the mission Dossier: The Convict aboard the Purgatory in Mass Effect 2.







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




Once Warden Kuril springs his trap on Shepard, the firefights begin. At the end of the hall in the room, right before you release Jack is where the Technician is waiting for you. As he frantically requests aid, he is killed by Shepard and the squad.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
The Technician is only armed with a pistol.
Defensive
The Technician has only health on lower difficulties and a light shielding on higher ones.

Tactics[]
The Technician is very weak as he has no armor and low shields, and only wields a pistol. A short burst from an assault rifle or one shot from a shotgun and the Technician is down.
