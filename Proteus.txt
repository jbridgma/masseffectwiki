Description[]
Like the hanar homeworld, Proteus has more than 90% oceanic cover. The incredible heat thrown off from Athens raises global humidity to 100%, creates constant cloud cover, and powers colossal typhoons that rage across the surface year-round.
Hot, humid, and storm-wracked, Proteus' rare combination of oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere and carbon-based biosphere nevertheless recommend it for colonization. A pilot program is studying the possibility of colonies below the ocean surface, safe from the worst effects of the weather.

Trivia[]
In Greek mythology, Proteus was one of the sons of Poseidon, and was a god of the sea.
Ithaka (Proteus' capital) may be named for the kingdom of Ithaca, the homeland of King Odysseus in Homer's poem The Odyssey.
