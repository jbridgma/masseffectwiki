Description[]
A small hydrogen-helium gas giant formed around a metallic hydrogen core, Elohi will be the site of a rare astronomical event later this year. The comet Asaro will come in on its orbit of 70 galactic standard years and travel so close to the giant that it is predicted to be captured as a moon. Dozens of space probes from around the galaxy have been launched into the Raheel system to record this moment.
Elohi is within the "frost line" of its parent star, where gas giants do not usually form. For this reason, it is believed to be an extrasolar capture.
TRAVEL ADVISORY: A statistically significant number of distress signals have come from the one-million kilometer mark around Elohi. Pirates are believed to be working the area. In-person tourism is not advised.

Trivia[]
Elohi can be rendered as either the Hebrew word for "God" with the addition of the singular possessive suffix, giving it the meaning "My god," or as simply the Hebrew word for "Divine." It is unclear which (if either) was intended.
