“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.





Taerve Uni is an Andromeda Initiative outpost on Voeld. It is available for development once Pathfinder Ryder increases the planet's viability to acceptable levels.
The outpost is led by Priya Blake‎. The outpost's name - Taerve Uni - comes from Shelesh, the angaran language, and means "forward together". It's a reference to a shared planet and the strong relationships between the outpost and the Resistance. 
The main activity of the outpost is the extraction of water, the most abundant resource on the planet. Taerve Uni runs ice drilling operations and is a spaceport for ice running missions. It makes sure that water is never a problem for the Andromeda Initiative by sending resources to the Nexus and other colonies. The outpost also provides water to the angaran Resistance all over the Heleus Cluster to help the war effort against the kett and reinforce the bond between the angara and the Initiative.
