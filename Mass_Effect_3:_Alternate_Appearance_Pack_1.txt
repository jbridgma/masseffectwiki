Mass Effect 2[]
The first Alternate Appearance Pack for Mass Effect 2 was released on March 23, 2010, and the second pack was released on February 8, 2011. The alternate outfits included do not require a character's loyalty mission to have been completed for squadmates to use them.[1]

Pack 1[]

The first pack includes three new outfits, one each for squadmates Garrus Vakarian, Jack, and Thane Krios.


“Jack straps on a black biker vest, low-slung jeans, and steel-toe boots made for starting riots. Garrus suits up in a new military-grade, blue-lit armor equipped with a dual-input communication headset. Thane slips into blood-red reflective shades and a new uniform for blending into the urban shadows.”



Pack 2[]

BioWare accepted suggestions for what to include in a second pack in August 2010.[2] Alternate Appearance Pack 2 was released on February 8, 2011. The pack contains new outfits for Grunt, Tali, and Miranda.[3]


“The Alternate Appearance Pack 2 gives new outfits to Miranda, Grunt, and Tali. How do you make Grunt feel at home? You can start by encasing him in 100 kilos of bullet-resistant plating! This krogan-built ensemble sends a message, but just what it says, we can’t repeat in polite company. Tali’s envirosuit gets an upgrade, armoring her delicate torso and projecting a heads-up-display on the inside of her visor. Being hermetically sealed from all contamination has never looked so good! Miranda shows her colors with the “do not touch” palette of Cerberus armor. Say goodbye to catsuits and hello to composite ceramics in bad-girl black! Alternate Appearance Pack 2 – Because it’s time to put the “war” back in “wardrobe.””
