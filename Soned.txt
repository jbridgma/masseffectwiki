Description[]
The massive kett Soned, translated as "resistance", rapidly unleashes plasma-surrounded projectiles after a brief charging period. Much of the Soned's size is devoted to insulating the user from its own power. A damaged Soned could incinerate its wielder's hands while continuing to fire. 

Features[]
The Soned is unable to use an Assault Rifle Scope Mod.
The Soned is highly unstable, and always arcs upward even with stability mods at Rank X.
The weapon received numerous improvements in multiplayer updates. Aside from increased damage and clip size, the Soned's rate of fire charge time improved to 0.5 seconds from 1 second. Firing from the hip and from behind barriers accuracy is also increased. While maximum accuracy while aiming down sights was slightly decreased, the accuracy penalty for firing is also reduced.

Strategies[]
The Soned's spin-up time makes it unsuitable for fast-paced battles or incoming melee attackers. Its wielder should be in a defensible position, with teammates fending off incoming enemies, for the gun to be effective. A Bulwark Soned is a natural fit in this scenario.
Due to its high initial weight and instability, only a few characters can wield a Soned with few issues. The Turian Havoc Trooper can counter both issues, though they require substantial investment in two skill trees.
