Dakka is a gateway system. Its inhospitable terrestrial worlds are rich in resources albeit safe extraction is an issue. Its giant planets are distinguished mainly as an ideal discharge point for Alkonost and a xenoarchaeological curiosity in one of the moons of Gamayun.
Batarians used to control Pragia, although ecological mistakes in colonization reduced it into a haven for lowlives and all manner of shady personalities.

Trivia[]
Dakka may be named after a temple in ancient Egypt dedicated to the god Thoth; this temple was located in the African region historically known as Lower Nubia, lending credence to the connection as the Dakka system is located within the Nubian Expanse. The other planets in the system (save for Pragia) are named after different creatures from Slavic mythology.
