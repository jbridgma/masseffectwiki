Gregor is a cut character that would have been present in Mass Effect during the deleted assignment Global Plot 1. He acts as Lysander Kostas' right-hand man, and a close ally and contact to Shepard on Noveria.
Gregor met Lysander at Nexxus, claiming he's been with him since the latter escaped. Since then, he's helped him gather incriminating data on Nexxus to take it down, having spent a year in Nexxus' security force. Gregor has also helped treating Voids, escaped Nexxus test subjects, for the company MindTech until Lysander relocated the group to a secret facility in the mountains for safety's sake.[1]
Shepard meets Gregor in MindTech's abandoned office on Noveria, though he initially shoots at Shepard's squad before engaging in conversation, having heard of Lucan's death. However, he quickly realizes Shepard doesn't actually know who Lysander and Vasilis really are, and Gregor tells the whole story.[2] He also finds out Vasilis has been intercepting his transmissions to Lysander, and may be mounting an attack against the secret facility. Gregor pleads Shepard to help him defeat him and his Nexxus forces, and says to meet him at a certain location in the mountains.
Once there, Gregor urges Shepard to follow him right away. If Shepard declines, he seemingly turns hostile. Otherwise, the group proceeds on foot to the facility, realizing that they're already too late. Inside, Gregor's fate is left indirectly to Shepard. Facing Vasilis's dilemma, Gregor originally wants to rescue his friends, but he eventually sees reason and reluctantly admits getting to Vasilis is more important. If Lysander's friends are rescued in time, Gregor stays with them for a time, meeting back with Shepard and Lysander after Vasilis is taken care of.[3] If Shepard goes after Vasilis immediately but then takes his deal to let him go, Gregor turns on Shepard and quickly ends up dead.[4] In every other case where Shepard eventually sides with Lysander, Gregor is told to accompany Shepard back to Port Hanshan when their business is done.[5]
