Description[]
Antirumgon is a small rock and ice planet, with a trace atmosphere of methane and ethane. The frozen surface is mainly composed of carbon with deposits of calcium.
Antirumgon has been used as a crude anchorage for Terminus pirates for many years. The shells of temporary dwellings blasted by Alliance frigate patrols dot the surface. But always, the pirates return to ground their ships' drive charges, chip out some water ice, and trade slaves and stories.
The deeper layers of Antirumgon's interior are semi-liquid slush, due to the presence of methanol. It is thought that bacterium in the deep core create this natural anti-freeze. Some species of Terminus pirate drill through the ice crust to recover this natural alcohol.

Trivia[]
The name Antirumgon and the description of pirate activity on the planet involving alcohol consumption are possible references to Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise, specifically his line from the first film, "But why is the rum gone?"
