Acquisition[]
Pathfinder Ryder receives the S.O.S. while driving along the path leading to the northwestern part of the map in the Kurinth's Valley region (very close to the location for Old Skinner).

Walkthrough[]
Follow the S.O.S. signal to its source[]
SAM indicates that the signal source is located to the northwest over the very high mountainous area in a valley and adds a navpoint . There is a building with two human Outlaw men that are sitting on a sofa. There doesn't seem to be any emergency. Located in the room is an Adapted Initiative Core Tech that can be scanned for +100 .
There are three datapads in the room: one on the table and two on a countertop.

Speak to the person who sent the S.O.S. signal[]
The "emergency" is that one of the plants is dying. The plant has some "medicinal properties", they say. Scanning the men reveals that they are "cognitively impaired". They are selling the plant to people who need medicine. Their problem is that the UV light is broken, and they would like you to find them one.
Scanning the Ultraviolet light and the Unknown plant award +10  each (+20  total).
Travel to the Haarfel region using the Forward Station. Head southeast of the Forward Station to the building where Task: Broken Family takes place and speak to the salarian refugee to get the UV light needed, then return to the two men to complete this mission.
You can now go back to the salarian refugee for a second time in the Haarfel region to acquire the mission Task: Herbal Entrepreneurs.
Note:  If you get the UV light BEFORE acquiring this mission (saving a trip back and forth), the mission Task: Herbal Entrepreneurs will automatically start when this mission is complete.
