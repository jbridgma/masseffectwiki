Description[]
A small hot rock with few resources, Maitrum is used by the turian armed forces for its maximum security prison and interrogation centers. The temperatures are high enough to prevent any escape without an environmental suit, but low enough that construction of additional buildings will not be hindered.
Over 500,000 prisoners are detained on Maitrum, only a handful of which have ever managed even a temporary escape. A small supply economy and prefab-habitats support the prison staff, who usually work only for two-year tours of duty before they are rotated out to less stressful positions.

Trivia[]
The planet's environment and role as a prison planet may have been inspired by the planet Crematoria in The Chronicles of Riddick.
