Basic - SR Scope: Simple optical scope to enhance stability while zoomed. Also increase accuracy while moving.
Enhanced - SR Recon Scope: Substantially increases accuracy, but at the cost of increased recoil.
Enhanced - SR Tactical Scope: Substantially increases accuracy, but at the cost of increased weight.
Note:  The Rank VIII SR Tactical Scope is incorrectly labeled as Rank IX. This leads to two Scope Mods with different stats with the same name.
Note:  Sniper rifle stability is not reflected in the displayed weapon stats.
