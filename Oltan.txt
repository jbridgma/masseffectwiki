Description[]
The first mission to Oltan, Dekuuna's moon, was a century in the making. Elcor leaders felt resources for space travel could be better used on their homeworld, and it took decades of persuasion to secure project funding.
Archaic harvesting stations that recovered helium-3 from the moon's regolith were still functioning when the Reapers invaded, and the elcor stationed there were able to flee the system.
