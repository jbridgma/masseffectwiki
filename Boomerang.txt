Mass Effect: Andromeda


The man known as Boomerang works in the Andromeda Initiative outpost on New Tuchanka, provided Initiative relations with the krogan has been restored. He sells weapons and weapon mods.

Background[]
Boomerang left the Nexus as an exile and became a scavenger on Elaaden. Ultimately he joined the gang led by Axius. 
His nickname came from Axius because he was beaten by the gang and abandoned for dead several times, but like a boomerang he always kept coming back.

Mass Effect: Andromeda[]
Boomerang is allowed back into the Initiative if Ryder brokers a peace between the Nexus and New Tuchanka. However, he is still in a probationary period and is supervised by authorities.
His fellow colonist Jonah Park deems him a good guy even if he's "a few screws short of the full ship." Boomerang's wares are of questionable origin, though his peers in the Initiative know better than to ask where he got them from. He once came back with a salarian thumb, thinking it might be useful someday.
