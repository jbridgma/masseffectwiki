Commander Shepard,

We here at the "Hour 20" news desk have been running pieces on the war's progress, and we'd like your cooperation in a small matter. We're searching for an iconic bit of footage for our lead-in to the segments, but most of our Reaper-related battle footage has issues with bad lighting, unstable cameras, and significant amounts of risk.

I'm not sure if you're aware, but the Armax Arena records its sessions. We'd like your permission to comb through videos of you fighting Reaper enemies for use in our segment. (The relevant forms for using your likeness are attached, and we'll compensate you for your time.) For maximum visual effect, we want only you in the shots. Just enter the simulator and fight Reaper enemies alone, and our visual composers can do the rest.

Yours,
Lara J. Delante

Walkthrough[]
You will need to use one of your prizes from a previous match to purchase Reaper enemies for the combat simulator. It is a Silver-level prize. After doing so, simply set the simulator to Reaper enemies and no squadmates, and complete the combat to finish the mission. Since most arena challenges are not mutually exclusive to each other, the other options can be set in a way to finish other arena challenges at the same time, e.g. Citadel Arena: Medi-Gel Challenge or Citadel Arena: Thermal Clip Challenge.
After the match, check the control terminal to read an e-mail congratulating Shepard.
