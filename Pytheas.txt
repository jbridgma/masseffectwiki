Pytheas is a system southwest of the Heleus Cluster's Black Hole. It is one FTL jump away from Eriksson and Pfeiffer. 






“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Following the Remnant vault's reset on Eos, Pytheas becomes the home system of the Andromeda Initiative's first officially successful colony, Prodromos.
The system has salvage, beryllium, and research easily accessible by ship. Resources for large-scale exploitation are locked away due to the usual inhospitable conditions.

Asteroid[]
DATA:

M-type asteroid
Diameter: 420 km
Surface gravity: 0.034 G
ANALYSIS:
An iron-nickel rich asteroid. Its dust indicates the same Scourge contamination that affects Eos.
Awards a random small amount of Iron when scanned.

Kett Orbital Cache 1[]
Note:  This anomaly is part of Task: Waking up to the Future.
DATA:

Multiple drop pods
Kett foodstuffs (theoretical)
Mixed resources
Mixed arms, armor
ANALYSIS:
Significant resource value, as predicted by tech Darket Tiervian.
Awards random Salvage when scanned.

Kett Orbital Cache 2[]
Note:  This anomaly is part of Task: Waking up to the Future.
DATA:

Multiple drop pods
Kett foodstuffs (theoretical)
Mixed resources
Tech components
ANALYSIS:
Significant resource value, floating on the vector that Darket Tiervian predicted.
Awards random Salvage when scanned.

Khonsu[]
Khonsu is the sixth planet orbiting the star Pytheas.

Main article: Khonsu
Nanuk[]
Nanuk is the fifth planet orbiting the star Pytheas.

Main article: Nanuk
Pele[]
Pele is the third planet orbiting the star Pytheas.

ZK Resource Tracker[]
Note:  This anomaly is part of The Little Things That Matter.
DATA:

Satellite ID: Encrypted
Power readings: ERROR
System report: ERROR
Status: ERROR
ANALYSIS:
This satellite tracks Initiative shipments and allocates emergency drops without authorization. No ZK-Tracker satellites were authorized or deployed by the Nexus.
Awards +50 , +29 AVP , +2% Eos viability when scanned.

Trivia[]
The system is named after the ancient Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia who explored Europe in antiquity. However, several of its worlds follow a more eclectic naming theme: 4 named from divine beings and only 1 of which is of Greek origin.
