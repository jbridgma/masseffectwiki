Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II (Mass Effect 3)


Arrae is a backwater system with little resources to offer. The turians attempted to lure renters and investors to Gellix and Antinax, but hostile surface conditions preclude any meaningful returns on investment. Only Erros has some commercial robo-mining activity centered around its accessible iron and copper deposits.
