Description[]
Phoros is a hydrogen gas giant, tinted orange by swirling bands of ammonia and sulfur. Its four moons hosted small spaceports used to mine the moons and the nearby Haelimar asteroid belt. Unfortunately, Phoros was an early target of the Reapers. They made short work of the lunar outposts. On sensors, no survivors or Reaper forces are immediately obvious, but Phoros's ring system is filled with dust and ice that would allow concealment.

Trivia[]
In Ancient Greece, phoros was the name for the membership dues paid to Athens by the members of the Delian League, formed to offer protection from Persian forces.
