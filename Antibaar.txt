Description[]
Antibaar is a cold terrestrial world with an atmosphere of methane and argon. Its frozen surface is mainly composed of iron with deposits of magnesium. The world has been noted as a possible target for long-term terraforming; if the atmosphere could be increased to the thickness of Earth's, the global average temperature would rise by 10 degree [sic] Celcius.
Antibaar's combination of low temperatures, high speed surface winds, and low visibility make it dangerous to explore on foot.
