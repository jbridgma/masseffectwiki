Kalusk is the krogan commander of the Blood Pack base on Zada Ban. 







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




He is killed in a firefight when Commander Shepard arrives to shut down the base.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Kalusk is equipped with an M-6 Carnifex heavy pistol, which is armed with Incendiary Ammo. Despite not having a shotgun, he still has the Carnage ability most krogan enemies possess. 
Defensive
Kalusk possesses strong shielding and armor, and like any krogan, has krogan charge and regeneration.

Tactics[]
Kalusk is the most powerful enemy encountered in the assignment. Upon entering the final area of the facility containing the generator, Kalusk will attack. Keep away from him and watch for a krogan charge. Eliminate other enemies first and then focus on Kalusk; by himself, the damage he can inflict shouldn't be serious. After Kalusk's shields and armor are broken, it should be easy to finish him off.

Trivia[]
Kalusk is notable as he is one of only two krogan (along with The Bounty Hunter) with a blue shield bar in Mass Effect 2. All others have armor, biotic barriers, or some combination thereof.
