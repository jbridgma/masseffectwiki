Pirate Elites are elite pirates encountered by Jacob Taylor alongside weaker Pirates. They are fought  on Cartagena, the station they have infiltrated. They can be recognized by their white color.

Tactics[]
Pirates elite have stronger health and kinetic shielding than their weak counterpart. Their shields will begin to regenerate 1.5 seconds after being disabled, but their health will not.
Pirates will attack at medium and short ranges with their assault rifles. Their shots don’t do much damage and they lack any special attacks.
It is recommended to prioritize your powers against them. Your Overload will instantly disable their shields while your Stasis will freeze them into place for a time.
