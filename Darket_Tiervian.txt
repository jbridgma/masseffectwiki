Formal request for Darket Tiervian, #28
Making the request again, Bradley. I know it's not your fault. I know she's supposed to be second wave. But I want a trail so that when all this calms down in a few years, we can get proper outraged about how long it took to reunite families. Especially ones hurt during the Site 1/2 mess. You know "Broken Promise" is a thing, right?

Requesting the deployment of Darket Tiervian, W-84-Krispin. Exo-studies specialist.

Reason: she's an asset that will help viability. She's also my daughter.
