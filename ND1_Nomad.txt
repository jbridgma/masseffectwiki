Specifications[]
The Nomad features twin hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells powering an element zero core, independent suspension for each wheel, and interchangeable four- or six-wheel drive. It comes equipped with helium-3 microthrusters beneath the vehicle to blast it upward, like with the Mako, and a rear fuel injection booster to propel it forward.
Unlike the Mako, the Nomad lacks any mounted weaponry such as a mass accelerator cannon or a machine gun, mostly due to the Initiative being a peaceful exploration project, and the Citadel Council restrictions on civilian weaponry. However, the Nomad can later on be equipped with a shield blast that can be used as defense to propel enemies away. 
The Nomad also comes with the capability to scan planet surfaces for valuable resources and deploy mining drones to harvest those. The maximum achievable speed of the Nomad is 161 km/h. 
While on worlds explorable by vehicles, the Nomad is represented by the  marker.

Customizations[]
Customizable Nomad components include the following:

Thrusters - Hold as much boost fluid as needed for greater maneuverability.
Shields - Additional power cells can briefly generate a protective field around the Nomad to protect the drive and its occupants when exiting the vehicle.
Shield Blast - If the Nomad loses its shield, in a last attempt to preserve shield integrity, the shield power cells will discharge causing an area of effect shockwave that will send nearby enemies flying.
Radar - Highlights enemies in the surrounding area.
Life Support - Provides more hazard resistance.
Paint Job - Customizable depending on environmental circumstances.
Upgrades and paint jobs are available for purchase from certain merchants.

Upgrades[]
Upgrades are installed immediately once they have been crafted.
Some upgrades are available for purchase from merchants. These upgrades can potentially cost much less than the total cost of the purchasing the materials for development.

Trivia[]
Of the navigable worlds, the only one in which the Nomad is not used is Havarl due to its gravity and small map.
While driving, Ryder's squadmates will engage in random and unique conversations, with different squadmates reacting to different discussions. One point of common reference, however, is at some point everyone will complain that only Ryder gets to drive the vehicle.
The color of the paint jobs can change depending on the environmental conditions that the Nomad is in. For example, on the bright and sunny world Eos, the Midas Touch paint job will appear bright gold, whereas on the dusty lower light world Kadara, the same paint job will appear a shiny muddy-brown.
