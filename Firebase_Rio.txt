The Central Tower makes for a great sniper nest. Not only do you have a good open view down both sides but there are two ammo crates very close by, so weapons like the M-98 Widow with low ammo capacity can be stocked easily.
For the same reasons the Central Tower is good for grenade-using characters like the N7 Demolisher Engineer.
Note, however, that much of the cover in the tower is positioned in such a way that being protected from your front exposes your rear. Be aware of potential attacks from behind.
The Loading Dock is a strong defensive location. It has ammo, plenty of cover, and long sightlines on the ramps leading from the Control Tower.
At the back of the Loading Dock is a container with large doorway and an ammo box inside. Players are immune to most instant-kill attacks while inside this container, since most enemies capable of such attacks are too large to enter the container themselves (the Phantom being a notable exception) and the floor of the container is slightly elevated from the ground. This makes for a useful "panic room" on higher difficulties, when enemies capable of instant kills spawn in large numbers.
Trivia[]
To the south of the map, players can see the city of Rio de Janeiro, as well as the famous Cristo Redentor.
