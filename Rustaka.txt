Description[]
This methane-ammonia gas giant was swept past during the Reaper invasion, and once its helium-3 collection equipment was destroyed, it was largely ignored. Vorcha ships that survived the attacks on Heshtok and Lihrat can be found discharging their drive cores here before making spy sorties or retreating further into space.
