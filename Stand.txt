The Stand is a location in the Citadel. Situated on the 26th level of a building in Zakera Ward's Mid-Ward District, the restaurant is managed by a male human chef. He describes ramen as an Earth delicacy, and believes that the meat offered on the station isn't very fresh so he offers dried seaweed instead. The Stand offers six kinds of beer on tap. In the past, the Stand had a karaoke machine; however, after complaints about drunk elcor singing, the machine was removed.


Trivia[]
The chef may shout the following greeting if approached: "Irasshaimase!" This is a Japanese expression of welcome commonly used by shopkeepers to greet customers.
