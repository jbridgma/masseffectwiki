The Alliance Requisition Officer is stationed in the SSV Normandy's storage section, immediately to the right side from the elevator, just behind the Mako.
He is not a quartermaster and thus does not issue equipment free of charge: he specialises in equipment outside the Alliance's standard range, trading privately and resupplying whenever the Normandy docks at a reasonably-sized port. This means that Commander Shepard has to pay him for his goods, rather than being issued them on request.
Shepard can also ask the Requisitions Officer about armory licenses. Purchasing new licenses permits the Requisitions Officer to trade in new lines of goods; if Shepard purchases a Geth Armory license, for instance, the Requisitions Officer can sell Geth Armory goods.

Trivia[]
The Alliance Requisition Officer is referred to as the Normandy Requisitions Officer in the Rich Achievement text in the original version of Mass Effect as well as the Prima game guide for the same.
Chris Postle, who voices the Requisitions Officer, also voices several other characters in the Mass Effect franchise: Jahleed, Manuel, and Corporal Toombs. Previously, he provided the voices for Shen and the Rat Demon in BioWare's Jade Empire.
