Description[]
Pre-Mission[]
An inhospitable, unstable volcanic planet. There is evidence of a large-scale Remnant complex, mostly buried beneath the surface. The mysterious signal that Peebee discovered emanates from a section of this complex.

Post-Mission[]
An inhospitable, unstable volcanic planet. The recent volcanic eruption has made landing and access to the buried Remnant complex impossible. Peebee's mysterious signal is now too faint to hone in on.

Missions[]
Peebee: Secret Project

Trivia[]
Pas-10's surface temperature changes after completing Peebee's loyalty mission due to the volcanic eruption. It is 32°C before the mission, and 49°C after.
