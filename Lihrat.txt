Description[]
The hydrogen-helium gas giant Lihrat was the site of a brief and decisive battle between vorcha and Reaper forces. It was impoliticly characterized on the news vids as "millennia-old death machines versus a gang of teenagers," a reference to the vorcha's brief life spans and inexperience. In reality, many of the ships were commanded by other species to avoid this shortcoming, but the insult still sticks.
The defenders outnumbered the Reapers, but their force was comprised of light ships suitable to a militia, since never before had it been in anyone's best interest to allow vorcha to build a dreadnought. Superior Reaper firepower soon wiped out the vorcha fleet, and the fuel infrastructure around Lihrat was pulverized. Rumors abound that the Reapers did not lose a single ship.
