Mass Effect (cut)


Horace is a cut character that would have been present in Mass Effect during the deleted assignment Global Plot 1. He's a turian mercenary, working to protect a group of Voids on Feros.
Horace, along with other mercenaries, was hired to protect Lucan's "Void" friends after Lucan's brother Dorian asked him to. That's how they came to take refuge somewhere on Feros. However, Lucan himself had to leave on his own after he started becoming dangerous to the group, which is how Shepard eventually finds the camp.
Horace remains quite vigilant throughout his initial conversation with Shepard. However, after an attack by Nexxus guards on the camp interrupts them, he comes to trust Shepard and allows one of the Voids, Drak, to trade with the Commander. Horace says this attack shows they're no longer safe, and they prepare to move again if he survived.[1]
