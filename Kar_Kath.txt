Appearances
Mass Effect (cut)


Kar Kath is a character who was cut from Mass Effect during development. He was a volus merchant on Throw Down on the planet Caleston.
Kar Kath repeatedly says he offers "goods and services", and has a rather awkwardly friendly attitude. He acknowledges that Caleston is a dangerous place as he seems to suggest buying "personal protection" to all his customers. During the course of Caleston: Last Man Standing, if Oronath is convinced to give up some medi-gel to cover his debt to the Miners' Union, Shepard can sell it to Kar Kath.[1]
