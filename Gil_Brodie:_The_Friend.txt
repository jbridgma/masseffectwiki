Come meet Jill! 
To: Ryder
From: Gil

Hey, next time we're on Eos, I'm meeting up with my buddy Jill. She'd love to meet you, and I kinda said you'd make an appearance. 

So don't make a liar out of me!

Meet Gil and Jill on Eos at Prodromos[]
Once you've located them on Prodromos, Pathfinder Ryder will speak with Gil about his friend Jill. Apparently Jill is on Eos to reverse the chemical procreation blockers given to all colonists. Gil crudely refers to this as "boosting the batter."
Depending upon your romance choices up to this point, you may have the option to deepen the romance with Gil by sharing a kiss.
Ryder and Gil speak a little bit more about procreation (or their relationship) until Jill flies in on a shuttle and interrupts that part of the conversation.
Jill has noticed that Gil has changed for the better and believes Ryder has something to do with it. Depending upon whether you're romancing Gil, the conversation with Jill changes but really is only about meeting and getting to know Ryder a little bit better.
The mission ends after the conversation is over.
