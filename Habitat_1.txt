Description[]
Nonviable[]
A desert world with significant resources, Eos is often wracked by deadly, radiation-contaminated storms.  Catalogued as nonviable after numerous attempts to settle.
ALERT: Signal detected, similar to the devices on Habitat 07. 

Viable[]
A desert world with significant resources, Eos is home to the first successful Andromeda Initiative outpost, Prodromos. (Founded by Pathfinder Ryder, Mayor August Bradley assigned.)

Codex Entry[]

Initial Entry[]
Eos, designated Habitat 1, was the earliest "golden world" identified for outpost placement. Named for the Greek goddess of dawn by Jien Garson personally, Eos embodied the hope of the Andromeda Initiative for a new start. 
On arrival, the Nexus discovered that a world projected to be arid but comfortably habitable was now ravaged by radioactive fallout from the Scourge. The planet's atmosphere is wracked by storms that have spread the radiation across continents; periodic 130km/hr winds strip equipment and damage shuttles. 
Reports from the Nexus include a sanitized account of two attempts to colonize the planet, both of which ended in failure and an unacceptable loss of life. There is also a significant kett presence on Eos, apparently investigating mysterious signals on the surface. Eos is now off-limits to unauthorized Nexus personnel, as the Nexus leadership believe it's no longer viable. 

Eos Vault Activated[]
Activating the vault discovered below Eos' surface has had a dramatic and immediate effect. Radioactive particles are being stripped from the atmosphere by unknown means, and the resulting temperature changes are calming Eos' high winds. The planets moisture levels are already showing improvement.

Eos Outpost Established[]
Prodromos, the first Pathfinder-established outpost, has been founded in Fairwinds Basin, with Mayor August Bradley in charge. The Nexus is broadcasting footage of departing colonists and the new conditions on Eos across all communication channels.

Anomaly[]
Architect Husk: Eos[]
Note:  This anomaly is available after completing Making An Impression.
DATA:
Classification: Enemy (decommissioned)
Origin: Andromeda (Eos)
ANALYSIS:
This Remnant Architect's programming directives have been interrupted. It is in an orbital standby mode and remains tethered to its home planet Eos. The Architect's systems are completing recovery from severe radiation exposure. The Architect itself appears to be conducting monitoring and analysis of Eos' atmosphere.

Environmental Information[]
Main article: Hazard

Eos is heavily contaminated by lethal levels of radiation prior to activation of the planet's vault. All areas outside of specially shielded zones like Site 1 pose an environmental hazard to personnel and vehicles.

SAFE CONDITION - RADIATION 0.001 mSv/hr
Hazard Level 1 - RADIATION 0.041 mSv/hr
Hazard Level 3 - RADIATION 55.765 mSv/hr
