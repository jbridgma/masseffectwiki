2.1 Speak with the Pathfinder VI

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: A Better Beginning

This task is available once all regions in the Common Area of the Nexus become accessible, after the establishment of Prodromos. 
Speak with the Cultural Center Liaison in the Cultural Center. The task is obtained the second time you talk to her.

Walkthrough[]
The liaison wants a favor from you at the conclusion of your introductory talk. The second time you talk to her, she reasons that the Pathfinder VI lost its settings in a crash, so you have to speak to it to control the information it presents.

Speak with the Pathfinder VI[]
The Pathfinder VI is just in front of the turian VI, also adjacent to the krogan VI. You can change the following settings:
Gender: male or female
Role: exploration or first contact
Team: organic team or partner AI
Glory direction: career advice for future Pathfinders or honor roll for former Pathfinders
Note:  This is a one-time deal, and you get a confirmatory dialogue before committing your final choices in case you change your mind. Some output may change the further you progress into the game, particularly the list of former Pathfinders, so you may want to consider your choices.
Once setup is complete, the VI avatar changes from murky static to a clearer, more uniform grey. The answers to these questions merely affect the responses given should Ryder or another being ask the VI for information about Pathfinders.
