Description[]
This armor integrates angaran hardware with Initiative software, resulting in a sturdy hardsuit that utilizes technologies unique to the Heleus Cluster. Various adjustments have been made to the design to accommodate non-angaran biology.

At Ranks III & IV, the existing description changes to add the following text: "Additional upgrades further regulate power distribution and the microframe computer's processing speed."
At Ranks V - X, the existing description changes to add the following text: "This heavily upgraded suit uses prototype components the angara designed, but lacked the resources to manufacture in bulk."
Types[]
Ranks I - X are named Angaran Guerrilla when the four armor pieces are crafted.
When the four armor pieces are found in-game:

Ranks I-II are named Angaran Guerrilla.
Ranks III-IV are named Angaran Ranger.
Ranks V-X are named Angaran Commando.
Note:  There are no differences between the found versions compared to the crafted versions (other than visual).

Player Notes[]
Features[]
Angaran armor features the strongest support for Tech powers, with increased power recharge speed and duration.

Strategies[]
Angaran armor is arguably the best choice for Tech-based power specialists, due to the increases in power recharge speed, effect duration, and tech construct damage inflicted on enemies.
As such, this armor synergizes well with the Infiltrator and Engineer profiles, stacking impressive boosts to all categories with the innate bonuses of the armor. The armor also helps to close the gap with the Biotic skill sets for power recharge speed and priming power to set up combos. Coupled with armor or weapon augmentations to further push this increase, players can have a near constant onslaught of fire, cryo, and electric damage at work on the battlefield from casts and constructs. 
Initially, players will find that this armor provides greater advantages to protection stripping and crowd control for weaker enemies; however, the enhanced strength of recharge speed and duration also makes a pure tech specialist a viable option. Rather than requiring a Tech power to strip defenses and then finish off with a weapon or combat/biotic power, and moves straight into a lethal cast of a fast power, such as overload or incinerate.
Because of this, the higher-ranking armor pieces heavily favor offensive thinking and strategies, using powers and constructs aggressively. Cautious players can use constructs from behind cover, letting enemies attack the Drone or Remnant VI as a decoy; alternately, players who want to draw in close can use weapons or powers to lay down a field of priming with quick follow-up shots to detonate the combo.
As with the other specialist armors, the main weakness is the reverse of its strength; while it has excellent boosts to tech abilities, it lacks defensive or non-tech skill boosts. This weakness can be tempered through the use of augmentations and crafting; however, given the strong base in tech skills, it is encouraged to build a play style around the armor.
