Capabilities[]
Offensive
Drones are armed with the standard Collector Assault Rifle. Drones, along with other Collector troops, have wings that they often use to drop into combat.
Defensive
Drones can have barriers at higher difficulty levels.

Tactics[]
Although they often enter areas by flying in with their wings, Drones do not begin attacking until they have landed, and once on the ground, they do not fly again. Drones can be attacked while airborne, and hitting them with powers such as Throw or Concussive Shot if they are unprotected by a barrier can knock them to an environmental death (demonstrated ability to fly notwithstanding).
Collector Drones should not be underestimated especially on higher difficulties, as they are fairly accurate and can wear down shields surprisingly fast. Taking them out first should be considered as they are easier to kill, and this also denies cheap options for Harbinger to possess.
Trivia[]
Given their noted insect-like characteristics, Collector Drones likely take their name from the term used to refer to certain hive-dwelling insects, most commonly male bees or ants. The word "drone" itself may have derived from an Old English root[1] that meant "male honeybee".
