Citadel: Cheaters Never Prosper is an assignment in Mass Effect which was cut during development. It would have taken place on the Citadel, and would have involved Shepard dealing with a cheater named Beck and a hanar.

Plotline[]
Commander Shepard comes across a cheater known as "Beck" who needs some "data." After the aforementioned data (which may be "unencoded") has been acquired, Shepard must choose between handing it to Beck, or helping a hanar by giving him the data or letting him collect Beck's reward. Shepard may then choose the nature of the reward (weapon or armor), which completes the assignment.[1]

Trivia[]
Beck was also part of the cut mission Citadel: Oculon Syndicate, where he may have gone against Harkin.
As with other cut Citadel side-plots, this assignment bears a strong resemblance to one that shipped in the final game: Citadel: Schells the Gambler, which also involves helping a cheater with obtaining data on the Citadel.
