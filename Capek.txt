Description[]
Baked in the fierce heat of a white sun, Capek is a rocky, waterless world wrapped in a haze of hydrogen and ethane. Sulfur and iron give yellowish and black tinges to much of the planet's surface. No registered settlements appear in the records, though there are clearly metallic anomalies that indicate roofed structures.

Trivia[]
It is likely that the planet is named after Karel Čapek, the Czech writer who first introduced the word robot. His play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) is set in a robot mass-production compound and tells a story of a robot uprising against humans caused by experiments that one of the scientists carries out on the robot's 'souls'.
