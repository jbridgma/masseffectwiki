>>The ancestral home of the angara is a lush jungle planet. However, scans detect plantlife on Havarl exhibiting maladaptive, unsustainable growth patterns. The abnormal mutation suggests something is terribly wrong with Havarl's ecology.

WHAT?! Unsustainable growth? Is this literally saying we either have no life on planets, or too much life? Are you kidding me? What's that weird human story about the bears and the porridge?

I expect that's not the normal life cycle of that plant you were looking at. And unpredictable patterns like that would wreak havoc on an ecosystem. My only guess is that it's caused by the Remnant technology present. If it can change the atmosphere of an entire planet, what's to say it couldn't somehow effect changes on a cellular level? The question is, is it working as intended (some twisted experiment), or malfunctioning? I'd prefer to say it's the latter, but I've learned not to make assumptions when it comes to Remnant.

My exploration was limited to a distance of ten feet from the Tempest bay doors, but initial findings are that Havarl's plant-life (and possibly all life) shows a marked tendency to mutate. Cells mutate and multiply in a way that results in the death of the organism. One might be able to compare it with cancer, I suppose.

In the brief hour or so I was on the ground, I watched a vine emerge from the ground, grow to maturity and then twist in and around itself, literally choking itself to death. I've sent footage.
