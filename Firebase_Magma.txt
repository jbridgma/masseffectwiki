Firebase Magma is a map in Mass Effect: Andromeda's multiplayer mode. It is a foundry built over a lava river.
Description[]
A lava field isn't the likeliest place for an industrial outpost, but outlaws built a facility here to harness its massive amounts of geothermal energy. This power then fuels advanced factories that create experimental weapons and incendiary munitions.
