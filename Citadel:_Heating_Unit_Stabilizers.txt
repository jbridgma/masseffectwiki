A salarian on the Citadel needs new heating unit stabilizers. Find them and bring them to him in the Presidium Commons.
Alternative journal entry:
Advanced heating unit stabilizers have been recovered from Noveria. Find someone on the Citadel who can use them.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven

Prerequisite: N7: Cerberus Fighter Base

A salarian named Sellea worries about unstable weather conditions dangerous to his sister's colony's egg clutches. He is located in front of the C-Sec Outpost in the Presidium Commons. Simply overhearing his comm conversation activates the mission.
Alternatively, the item and the journal entry can be acquired simultaneously during an offensive against Cerberus in Noveria.

Walkthrough[]

The heating unit stabilizers can be obtained during N7: Cerberus Fighter Base, in the same room as the mission objective to disable the base's security. Opposite the terminal to do that is a wall panel containing the stabilizer schematics. Shepard calls them "advanced," quipping it gets really cold here.
Alternatively, if the mission is finished without finding them, they can be purchased from the Spectre Requisitions terminal for 1,000 credits.
Turn in the stabilizers for an update on the Salarian Third Fleet War Asset. Interacting with Sellea again after turning in the stabilizers allows you to overhear his half of a comm conversation. His sister's egg clutch has stabilized, and she wants to name the firstborn after the person who helped them.
Note: The fighter base is inaccessible until after Priority: Tuchanka. Returning the heaters to the Citadel is not possible until after Priority: The Citadel II.
