Acquisition[]
This mission becomes available when the relationship arc with Lexi has advanced far enough. This will be after Lexi asks Pathfinder Ryder if she is uptight. The next time you dock on the Nexus, Suvi will call you about the whereabouts of the doctor. This starts the mission. An email will also be sent by Anan T'Mari.




You ship's doctor
To Ryder:
From: Anan T'Mari

Pathfinder:

Your ship doctor's been in the Vortex a fair amount lately. Alone. It's not my business to meddle in customer business, just pour, but you might want to see how she's doing.

Walkthrough[]
Find Lexi on the Nexus[]
Head to The Vortex on the Nexus. 
Lexi is concerned that Peebee thinks she only looks at the crew like experiments. This hurts her as this is what every one of her exes has said to her in the past.
Lexi asks if this is how you view here. You can respond yes or no and the conversation changes slightly based upon the answer given.
Lexi then decides to finish her drinking another day. The conversation then ends and the mission completes.
Note: This mission can be used to advance the "romance" with Lexi.

Aftermath[]
Lexi will send an email.




Thank you
To: Ryder
From: Lexi

Ryder, 

I appreciate you coming to find me on the Nexus. I apologize for running off like thatâ€”it was unprofessional and won't happen again. One day, when things calm down, we should get drinks for real. Unwind like friends. Purely platonic, of course.


Lexi
