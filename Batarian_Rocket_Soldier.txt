Batarian Rocket Soldiers are batarian fighters that are armed with an assault rifle which has the ability to fire rockets by switching fire mode[1] and are more effective against vehicles.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




During the mission to stop batarians from crashing an asteroid into the human colony of Terra Nova, Rocket Soldiers are deployed at the interior and exterior of the various fusion torch stations around X57.

Tactics[]
Rocket Soldiers will tend to stay at a distance and fire rockets to take out vehicles and infantry at range. They also tend to stay in cover and frequently don't stick their heads out for very long. In close combat, Rocket Soldiers will still fire their weapons and use melee attacks to fight off enemies.
