Description[]
Naxell is an ammonia-methane ice giant. Several smaller energy corporations shut out of the big market in the Faia gateway system are attempting to develop a local helium-3 fuel mining infrastructure to service Illium. The leading investor is the human corporation Eldfell-Ashland Energy. Their efforts have been hampered by the extralegal pressure the "H-3 Cartels" in Faia system can bring to bear, from simple price undercuts to bureaucratic obstructions (denied permits and constant "health and safety" inspections).
