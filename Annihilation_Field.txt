Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Annihilation Field deals 1.5x damage to armor and barriers.[1]
Blast damage from detonating the field will go through walls and cover. If the player is behind walls or cover, and detonates the field, any nearby enemies within the blast zone will be affected by the blast.
Annihilation Field persists even if a character is downed, allowing it to damage or even kill nearby enemies.
Only enemies within the radius of effect are primed for a Biotic Explosion; thus, if you move too far away from the enemy, the priming effect (indicated by a purple bolt) is lost.
It is possible to repeatedly walk back and forth near enemies to re-prime them quickly for numerous explosions.
The Rank 4 "Impact Radius" evolution creates a small but noticeable increase in the range at which the priming effect becomes active, as well as how far away from the enemy you must move for the effect to wear off. The priming range starts at roughly "handshake distance," and with the radius evolution, it is increased to a couple of meters.
With the Rank 6 "Drain" evolution, detonating Biotic Explosions on primed targets will restore your barrier for the full damage of the explosion. In some cases, this can bring back your barriers immediately.
Unprotected organics affected by the field may panic, which can make the user much less vulnerable to being flanked at point-blank range.
Annihilation Field's manual deactivation can detonate all four types of combo.
Strategies
Annihilation Field is one of only 3 powers that can set up and detonate Biotic Explosions on any enemy at any time (the others being Warp and Reave). This makes it very useful in a biotics-heavy party.
Since it does damage automatically and auto-targets once the foe is in range, Annihilation Field can be a very effective deterrent towards Swarmers.
Enemies that inflict a post-mortem explosion, such as Possessed Abominations and Seeker Plagues, should be taken out with extreme caution when you are engaged in close-quarter combat, since Annihilation Field's damage-over-time effect may kill them unexpectedly within a lethal distance.
The panic effect of the field on most unprotected organics should be used strategically whenever possible to reduce the risk of close encounters.
