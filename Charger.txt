Description[]
This sturdy submachine gun is standard-issue inside the Andromeda Initiative's security forces. The Initiative commissioned the automatic Charger from Elanus Risk Control Services. The company heavily customized one of their existing weapons to meet Initiative needs.

Features[]
The Charger looks like the M-9 Tempest submachine gun from Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, though it has a few key differences. It has a slightly slower rate of fire and a bit more stable than the Tempest, in addition to having different firing sounds.
Squadmate Liam Kosta wields a Charger as his weapon of choice. 

Strategies[]
The Charger is the most basic submachine gun model available. Weak and inaccurate, its use is largely restricted to close quarters combat where its good rate of fire and large clip size make it easier to land hits on fast-moving targets. Engaging enemies at mid-range or more is not recommended, but if the situation requires it, burst-firing is advisable to counter the weapon's rapidly deteriorating accuracy on full-auto.
A fully upgraded Charger can prove a reliable piece of equipment in its niche, but the gun is generally outperformed by almost any other submachine gun in the game. Players who make frequent use of submachine guns may want to switch it out for another model as soon as possible. Players looking for a powerful CQC handgun should consider picking up an M-358 Talon instead.

The Charger's rename was most likely done to avoid confusion with Ryder's ship, the Tempest.
