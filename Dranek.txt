Dranek was also mined out during the Krogan Rebellions, although in recent times it still has moderate to rich amounts of resources in largely unexplored regions. Element zero deposits can be found in the infamous planetoid Rothla.
As with most of the Krogan DMZ, the CDEM enforces the strict prohibition against arming krogan starships here. They have also quarantined Rothla, citing previous mishaps around the area.
