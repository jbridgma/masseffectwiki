Description[]
A dry, desolate planet, Ker is temperate but supports little life above the microscopic level. Its Earth-like temperatures and gravity make it an appealing place to build habitation hideaways, attracting batarian slavers and criminals who can't afford more luxurious safehouses on other planets. Its forgiving nitrogen-helium atmosphere makes EVAs possible with a minimal amount of equipment; a breathing mask and warm clothing is [sic] usually sufficient.
Mining and other legitimate activities are few and far between on Ker: the planet's crust is largely free of precious metals, instead producing kilometers upon kilometers of dolomitic limestone, calcite, and gypsum.
ALLIANCE BULLETIN: Geth have been encountered in the Hekate system. All civilian traffic is prohibited.
