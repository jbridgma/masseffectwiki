Description[]
Mass Effect 2[]
Jonus, a methane-ammonia ice giant, is being developed as a fuel depot serving the Pylos Cluster. Eldfell-Ashland Energy has established a base on one of its moons to crack water ice into hydrogen and oxygen, and skim helium-3 from its atmosphere. Jonus is also believed to be an extrasolar planet captured by its star.
From orbit, Normandy's sensors can pick out a hand-painted sign some waggish employee has left outside the complex: "Last chance fuel for 100 light years."

Mass Effect 3[]
Jonus, a methane-ammonia ice giant, is believed to be an extrasolar planet captured by its star. It was developed as a fuel depot serving the Pylos Cluster. Eldfell-Ashland Energy had established a base on one of its moons to crack water ice into hydrogen and oxygen and skim helium-3 from its atmosphere. The Reapers destroyed both the base and the abandoned infrastructure but not before triggering a trap--a crude nuclear device meant to catch them in its blast.
From orbit, the Normandy's sensors can pick out a sign that some waggish employee has left on the wreckage of the moon base: "Gone fission."
