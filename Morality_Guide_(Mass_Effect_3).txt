This page is intended to show the exact conversation and/or action triggers to receive Paragon and Renegade points.
Note:  Due to Javik being DLC but integrated into conversations from almost the beginning of the game, all interactions with him are understood to require Mass Effect 3: From Ashes or Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Likewise, in the absence of explicit qualifiers any interactions with characters who can die or otherwise absent are understood to require said characters to be alive and present.
