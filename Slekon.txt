Description[]
Orbiting at an unbelievable distance of 710 AU (over 66 billion kilometers) from Gorgon, Slekon is a huge gas giant, with an atmosphere tainted by methane and chlorine.

Properties[]
Its 17.8 sol-mass star cannot have formed before 7.48 million years ago. At that age, Jupiter had a radius upward of 100,000 km.
Slekon is more likely a young Neptune in mass.

Trivia[]
The star chart for the system depicts Slekon with its rings.
While 710 AU (about 106,2 billion km) as stated in the description is more than 66 billion kilometers, the distance corresponds to about 66 billion miles rather than kilometers.
