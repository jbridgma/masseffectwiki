“The Lazarus Project will proceed as planned.”
An overhaul is planned for this article. (Discuss)



Mass Effect 3 is based on Unreal Engine 3 and many settings can be modified in a way similar to Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, allowing the user to mod, tweak or cheat.

Preface[]
Back Up Your Career[]
Using the modifications described in this article may alter your SP career permanently. It is recommended to backup your career for the option to revert back later on. The career files' default locations are in the following:
Windows XP:
Documents and Settings\%Username%\My Documents\BioWare\Mass Effect 3\Save
Windows Vista and up:
Documents\BioWare\Mass Effect 3\Save
The career folders are named in the format John_31_Soldier_160312_4a1d758 (first name, psych profile/history, class, date of creation, unique hash numbers).
There is also a profile file called LocalProfile.sav under the same folder in Documents\BioWare\Mass Effect 3\Save  that you may want to backup. This file stores your achievements and bonus power unlocks.

Tools[]
Wenchy Coalesced Utility
This is the recommended editor for novices. It has a User interface. Easy to browse and search by address all .ini files that are in coalesced.bin container, and move values across different inis. You can only copy or move one value at a time, though. This tool does not properly work with DLC coalesced.
Mass Effect 3 Mod Manager / ME3Tweaks Mod Manager
Mass Effect 3 Mod Manager (ME3CMM) and ME3Tweaks Mod Manager (M3) are end-user focused mod managers for Mass Effect 3 and the trilogy, respectively. They facilitate the installation and uninstallation of most non-texture mods, as well as other user features such as DLC backup, keybindings injection, diagnostics and more. It also contains tools for developers like starter kit (easy DLC mod creation).
For Coalesced editing, TankMaster's Coalesce Tool is available as part of Mass Effect 3 Mod Manager, and is available in ME3Tweaks Mod Manager starting with Build 105. This tool extracts Coalesced files into xml files which can be easily manipulated with your favorite text editor.
To decompile a Coalesced file, simply drag and drop a Coalesced file (.bin) onto Mod Manager's interface. To recompile, drag the manifest file (named the same as the original dropped file, but with a .xml extension) back onto the interface. If the file does not compile, ensure your xml files are valid with a tool such as XML Validation. 
Gibbed Coalesced.bin Extractor | Gibbed DLC Coalesced.bin Extractor   These tools work with the basegame Coalesced.bin and DLC ones (either or, but not both, there are two tools). It converts .bin into .json text files when you drag the coalesced.bin file onto the .exe. When you are done with editing, drag the decompiled folder onto the .exe again and it will compile a new .bin.
Note: Gibbed's DLC Coalesced.bin Extractor does not properly serialize Type 3 and Type 4 entries which will make duplicate elements appear in multiple places in the game, such as maplists and store items. You should use the TankMaster version if you want to edit DLC.
Gibbed's compiler has been deprecated and should be avoided due to the bugs in it.
Note:  This tool converts the file into .json format. This means you can use certain JSON-editors to see an overall structure, but navigating the text file itself will be different from what's described in this article. However, if you search for the parameters mentioned in this document, you should be able to find them.
ME3Tweaks has guides for modding ME3 through Coalesced edits, PCC editing, and using the console for modding. It additionally hosts mods for Mass Effect 3.
ME3Tweaks ModMaker is an online editor that lets you tweak the stats of many multiplayer variables such as wavelists, powers, and maps to name a few. Decompiling/recompiling files by hand is not required. It is designed to work with Mod Manager. 
ME3Explorer
A toolset with tools to mod all three games in the trilogy, including package editing, scripts, meshes, and more. This toolset is used for nearly all mod development. Ensure you are using the ME3Tweaks Fork as the main version (3.0) has been abandoned.

Location of Configuration File[]
Note:  Before making any edits, make sure to make a backup of an original Coalesced.bin file. If you happen to lose your Coalesced.bin file, right click on ME3 in Origin and do a repair install. It will find Coalesced.bin is invalid and download a new copy.
Windows XP/Vista/7 64bit:
Mass Effect 3\BIOGame\CookedPCConsole\Coalesced.bin
DLC configurations files are stored in a .sfar archive. It can be found in a specific DLC folder under DLC folder.
Mass Effect 3\BIOGame\DLC\%DLC_FOLDER_NAME%\CookedPCConsole\Default.sfar
After unpacking Default.sfar you should get a set of catalogue. Configuration files can be found here:
BIOGame\DLC\DLC_FOLDER_NAME\CookedPCConsole\Default_%DLC_FOLDER_NAME%.bin

Multiplayer warning[]
BioWare employees have stated in multiple forum sessions that single-player modifications are allowed, but changes that affect the multiplayer aspect of the game may result in a ban if you attempt to use them online.
Many of tweaks contained in this article will affect both SP and MP gameplay.  If you choose to use them for SP, it is recommended that you switch to an unmodified Coalesced.bin for any multiplayer matches.

Misc Coalesced.bin Tweaks[]
This section is for assorted tweaks and cheats that enhance or alter gameplay. 

Codex Voiceover Delay Length[]
This tweak delays the voiceover in Codex entries, effectively silencing it if given a large enough number.
Go to  [bioui.ini > sfxgame > sfxgui > journalcodex]

fvoiceoverdelay = 999.0

Eliminate Store Mark-up[]
Go to [bioui.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxgamechoiceguidata > storedata > normandy]

markuppercent = 0.1f

Change 01f to 0.0f.
This will eliminate the store mark-up at the Acquisition Board on the Normandy, allowing you to buy things there at the same price as at the various stores.
Note:  You can change it to negative values for a discount, but anything equal or higher than 1.0f crashes the game at start up. Having too many credits while buying might also crash your game.

Unlock Stores and Bonuspowers[]
Stores: [bioui.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxgamechoiceguidata > storedata > normandy > storeitemarray]
Bonuspowers: [bioui.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxgamechoiceguidata > storedata > bonuspowers > storeitemarray]
To unlock each item, remove the part "PlotUnlockConditionalID=XXXX" from each line you wish to unlock.

Note:  Leviathan DLC will revert these changes. You must edit the DLC coalesced in the same way. Extract Default_DLC_EXP_Pack001.bin from \\DLC_EXP_Pack001\Default.sfar with program "ME3 Explorer" > DLCexplorertool > File > Load > selectDLCpackage. and then edit the coalesced. After editing you need to replace the original Default_DLC_EXP_Pack001.bin in Default.sfar with your modified one.


Editing War Assets[]
Go to [bioui.ini > sfxgame > sfxgawassetshandler > allassets]
To change the value of a War Asset, edit the "StartingStrength" value.  To negate the Galactic Readiness penalty, for example, you can double all the values.
Example:

(ID=0,AssetName="GAWAsset_AllianceEngineeringCorp",Type=GAWAssetType_Military,SubType=GAWAssetSubType_Ground,StartingStrength=260,GUIName=715401,GUIDescription=715515,bIsExploration=False,UnlockPlotStates[0]=0,GUICategoryID=1,DebugConditionalDescription="None",bShowNotificationOnAward=false,ImagePath="gui_codex_images.galaxyAtWar.GM_HumansNoArmor_512x256",NotificationImagePath="")


Note:  Any changes to War Assets already collected in a game in progress will not be affected by any changes to Coalesced.  (You can only change assets you don't already have.)  For maximum effect, make any changes before starting a new game.


Find interaction objects more easily[]
Setting the highlight distance to make it easier to find interactable objects:
Go to [Biogame.ini > sfxgame > bioplayerselection]

maxhighlightrange=800

8000 works nicely and highlights objects far enough out to cover your visible range easily.


Split and rebind the Use/Cover/Roll/Storm keys[]
Video tutorial
Written tutorial (archive)
A better/easier way to improve the controls is installing the Intuitive Controls Mod.


Eliminate Weight Penalty[]
Go to [biogame.ini > sfxgame > sfxcharacterclass]
Change encumbrancemaxcooldown and encumbrancemincooldown both to -2.0f.
This will eliminate the weight penalty on your powers, allowing you to take the full 200% cooldown bonus with any combination of weapons.
Increasing encumbrancemaxcooldown will increase your base cooldown bonus.  Changing it to -3.0f, for example, would result in a 300% cooldown bonus.

Exploration Tweaks[]
Expand the Normandy scan range
Go to [Biogame.ini > sfxgame > bioplanet]

m_fscandetectionrange=60

Anything over 240 should cover an entire system in one scan.

Increase the Fuel Capacity
Go to [Bioweapon.ini > sfxgame > sfxinventorymanager]

maxfuel=1000

This can go up to 9000 and beyond.

Improve Normandy Fuel Efficiency:
Go to [Bioweapon.ini > sfxgame > sfxinventorymanager]

fuelefficiency=1.5

The lower the number, the less fuel used (0.0 - Infinite).

Speed of the Planet Scan Reticle:
Go to [Bioinput.ini > sfxgame > sfxgamemodeorbital]

reticledegreespersecond=90

This is the reticle speed when not scanning. (Higher number = faster.)

scanningreticledegreespersecond=35

This is the default reticle speed when scanning.  (Higher number = faster.)  

Reapers' detection time and Chase
Go to [Biogame.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxgalaxymapreaper]
Reduce all of these to nerf the reapers, or increase them to make searching for war assets more of a challenge.
How quickly they catch up to you:

acceleration = 5.0

How easily they find you:

m_fscandetectionrange = 300

How fast they can go:

maxspeed = 67.5



Get Maximum Level and Talents for all Squad Members[]
To generate enough skill points to max all skills at level 60:
Go to [biogame.ini > sfxgame > sfxgameconfig > levelrewards]
Go to the first line and change it to:

(Level=1,ExperienceRequired=0,TalentReward=11,HenchmanTalentReward=18)

Note:  Because ME3 recalculates skill points at every scene load, you can add the extra points needed to any levelrewards line and it will update your character with the extra points automatically.  If you are already partway through a game, add the extra to your next level.

Quick skip to level 60:
Go to [bioinput.ini > sfxgame > sfxgamemodedefault > bindings]
Add this line:

( Name="NumPadOne", Command="givexp 180000" )

Editing Store Contents[]
All stores can be found here: [bioui.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxguidata > store]
Here you will find subsections, corresponding to each stores in the game ("asari" is nos astra, "batarian" is batarian state arms, and so on).
Each of those "stores" have a subsection called "storeitemarray". In this subsection, you will see items available from the store. Items are categorized in several 'types'. Type name is in capital letters. To unlock item, modify the item's line.

For types - WEAPON and MOD:set PlotUnlockConditionalID=XXXX to PlotUnlockConditionalID=0OR remove PlotUnlockConditionalID=XXXX,PlotPurchaseID[0]=XXXXX
For types - ARMOR, UNIQUEARMOR, QUEST, INTELBONUSES:set PlotUnlockConditionalID=XXXX to PlotUnlockConditionalID=0OR remove PlotUnlockConditionalID=XXXX

Example:

For instant purchase access to level 5 SMG damage upgrade, go to "asari > storeitemarray = multiple", and modify the value:
(ItemType=TYPE_MOD,ItemClassName="SFXGameContent.SFXWeaponMod_SMGDamage",BaseCost=4000,PlotUnlockConditionalID=1535,PlotPurchaseID[0]=21304)

to

(ItemType=TYPE_MOD,ItemClassName="SFXGameContent.SFXWeaponMod_SMGDamage",BaseCost=4000)

When in game, you will be able to purchase the SMG damage mod from lvl 1 to 5 instantly from Nos Astra Sporting Goods.


Editing Intel Bonuses[]
The Intel bonus "store" can be found here: [bioui > sfxgamecontent > sfxguidata > store > intel > storeitemarray]
To unlock each intel bonus, remove the part ",PlotUnlockConditionalID=XXXX" from each intel drop you wish to unlock. Also, setting the value XXXX to 0 (zero) should do the trick too.
Note:  This is tested and mostly working. The intel drops are unlocked and you can pick a bonus from each one but they don't disappear after as they're intended to and it allows both bonuses to be obtained.
Additionally, you can alter the values of the bonuses by going here: [biogame > sfxgame > sfxpawn > player > permanentgameeffects]
This list contains both of the unlocked bonuses for each of the 13 intel drops (26 total). Altering the field "Value=0.05" will alter the value of the bonus. 
Example:
Value=0.05 = 5% bonus
Value=0.10 = 10% bonus


Editing FOV[]
Go to [bioinput.ini > sfxgame > sfxgamemodedefault > bindings]

( Name="F1", Command="set SFXGame.SFXCameraMode FOV 90" )

You can change "F1" to any other key you want. You can also change 90 to another value acceptable for you; it is said that the best FOV would be in the range of 90 to 120, inclusive[1].


Enable joystick move (useful for those who want to use mouse while having access to analog movement)[]
Go to [Bioengine.ini > winDrv > windowsClient]
change this:

allowjoystickInput=0

into this:

allowjoystickInput=1

Go to [bioinput.ini > SFXGame > SFXGameModeBase > Bindings]
Paste in:

( Name="XboxTypeS_LeftX",Command="Axis aStrafe Speed=1.0 DeadZone=0.3")

( Name="XboxTypeS_LeftY",Command="Axis aBaseY Speed=1.0 DeadZone=0.3")

( Name="XboxTypeS_RightX",Command="Axis aTurn Speed=0.2 DeadZone=0.3")

( Name="XboxTypeS_RightY",Command="Axis aLookup Speed=0.2 DeadZone=0.3")

Comes in useful for steam controller users or gamepad users who want to bind gyro to a mouse.

Disable the intro movie (EA logo)[]
Go to [bioengine.ini > fullscreenmovie > startupmovies] and add a semicolon in front of the ME3_sig_logo value to show like this

;ME3_sig_logo



Tweaking the Bloom lighting setting[]
The setting can be found here: [Biogame.ini > sfxgame > bioworldinfo]

defaultpostprocesssettings=...

This value has a long string of settings, but you would only change 

Bloom_Scale=0.2

and leave everything else intact.
The higher the value, the brighter/bigger Bloom lighting will be. Work with small increments, lower than 1 recommended. The game accepts negative values.


Turn the CommandMenu into toggle on/off instead of 'hold key' mode[]
Go to [BioInput.ini > sfxgame > sfxgamemodebase > bindings]
change this:

( Name="PC_ExitCommandMenu", Command="OnRelease ExitCommandMenu" )

into this:

( Name="PC_ExitCommandMenu", Command="ExitCommandMenu" )

Now you don't need to hold the button for the CommandMenu to stay active. Instead it is now a toggle: push once to activate, push again to exit.

Change reputation thresholds for dialog options[]
Go to [biogame.ini > sfxgame > sfxgame]
In this section is a variable "reputationthresholds". It lists the various lower limits for reputation dialog unlocks and can be tweaked however you see fit.

In-game Console[]
This section is for information on how to enable and use console on PC.
Unlike bindings, console can be used any time in the game.

Enabling game console[]
    Mini version of console. Covers one line of the height.  
Using the DLC Patcher, originally created by WarrantyVoider and now maintained by Erik-JS, is the simplest and easiest way to enable the console without having to modify any files. These DLL files will also unlock the full set of console commands. Hex editing the .exe does not and will not enable modified DLC.
The patching method described below is kept for historical purposes only.
As of 2014 This tutorial is the most recent (and easiest) way to enable the console. 
In order to use the console you require a HEX editor (e.g., HxD). In build 1.5.5427.124, you need to patch the bytes in MassEffect3.exe (at file offset 0x1515D64 from (20 1D 6B) to (30 A3 D5). Video tutorial

In case that option not appear, try search at 0х1514564
Origin Trilogy version has offset at 0x1515d60
Origin Digital Deluxe Edition has offset at 0x1515d61
The Ultimate Collectors Edition from 3DM has offset at 0x1514533 or 0x151456E
Note:  An alternative to ingame console. There is a tool/plugin for managing key-bindings. You can assign buttons to execute commands from external text files. "External console"
Outdated game versions:

Patch 1.2, build 1.2.5427.16: MassEffect3.exe, offset 0x1518AEC from (A0 7B 6B) to  (60 31 D6).
Patch 1.3. build 1.3.5427.46: MassEffect3.exe, offset 0x151DCEA from (90 38 6A) to (B0 91 D5).
Patch 1.4. build  1.4.5427.111: MassEffect3.exe, offset 0x151DCEA from (40 7E 6B) to (90 25 68). Video tutorial
Demo: MassEffect3Demo.exe, offset 0x150699C from (00 53 D3) to (70 47 D5).
Bear in mind that there could be no visible output from your commands, but they will work (if properly entered).
For example, from the main menu, try the command open BioP_MPNov.
On non-US Windows setups you may need to redefine the console keys (Tilde usually doesn't work otherwise). Example:

coalesced.bin -> bioinput.ini/engine/console
consolekey = F11
typekey = F12

List of commands[]
With console commands you can instantly change different aspects of the game; for example, give Shepard and squad weapons, change camera modes, slow time, open maps and more.
All commands can be entered in console or keybinded (See "In-game Commands" chapter). Commands are NOT case sensitive (except for 'loadgame' and 'savegame'). If you want, you can write only small letters.
A master list was dumped by FemShep and can be found here. ME3Tweaks also has some information on console commands which can be found here.

To walk around in the Cerberus HQ, use the ToggleFlyCam and Teleport Commands to teleport yourself into the HQ that is located above the Bridge. You can spot it more easily with viewmode unlit. To continue on as normal through the mission, teleport yourself into the left upper control room and interact with the console. Audio will still be impaired.


Bindings and commands[]
This section is for information on commands that can be activated through key bindings. For a full list of keys that are bindable, see the UDK/UE3 documentation. The Xbox keys are bindable if bUseConsoleControls and AllowJoystickInput values in Coalesced are set to true. Xbox controls do not work in the interface without specific interface mods.
Keybinds are one or several console commands assigned to any key on keyboard or mouse or controller. Most of them do not work during cutscenes, depending on the command itself and its placement/s within the file, and some effects may be reset when you are not in control of Shepard.
But if you want to make keybinds for cutscenes and other game modes, refer to this tutorial project: https://web.archive.org/web/20160814231008/https://social.bioware.com/project/8334/
All normal mode keybindings are found here:

bioinput.ini > sfxgame > sfxgamemodedefault > bindings
On the right side of the editor you will see the existing keybindings.
Scroll down to the bottom where there will be a blank line.  Add any new bindings one at a time.  Press 'enter' once you've entered a new binding to start a new line. 
Keybinding command structure:

( Name="BUTTON",Command="COMMAND" ) 
For BUTTON, substitute any key not already in use on another binding.
For COMMAND, substitute any valid ME3 command.
Multiple commands can be executed on a single binding by separating them with <space>|<space> like this:

( Name="BUTTON",Command="COMMAND1 | COMMAND2 | COMMAND3" ) 
Note: You can map commands to any key, provided it's not already used in-game. If it is, remap that key in-game using the Option/Key Bindings menu before you make any changes to the coalesced.bin file.





Keybind examples[]
Unlock EVERY weapon in the game (for real this time):

 ( Name="NumPadZero", Command="giveitem self argus | giveitem self avenger | giveitem self cobra | giveitem self collector | giveitem self falcon | giveitem self gethplasma |  giveitem self mattock | giveitem self reckoning | giveitem self revenant | giveitem self saber | giveitem self valkyrie | giveitem self vindicator | giveitem self carnifex | giveitem self eagle | giveitem self ivory | giveitem self phalanx | giveitem self predator | giveitem self scorpion | giveitem self talon | giveitem self thor | giveitem self claymore | giveitem self crusader | giveitem self disciple | giveitem self eviscerator | giveitem self graal | giveitem self katana | giveitem self raider | giveitem self scimitar | giveitem self striker | giveitem self hornet | giveitem self hurricane | giveitem self locust | giveitem self shuriken | giveitem self tempest | giveitem self blackwidow | giveitem self incisor | giveitem self indra | giveitem self javelin | giveitem self mantis | giveitem self raptor | giveitem self valiant | giveitem self viper | giveitem self widow | giveitem self sfxweapon_shotgun_geth | giveitem self sfxweapon_assaultrifle_prothean" ) 

Enough credits to buy everything up to Level X:

( Name="NumPadSeven", Command="initcredits 9000000" )


To set your paragon / renegade scores:

( Name="NumPadEight", Command="setrenegade 1000" )
( Name="NumPadTwo", Command="setparagon 1000" )


To reset paragon / renegade scores, set value to 0.

( Name="NumPadEight", Command="setrenegade 0" )
( Name="NumPadTwo", Command="setparagon 0" )


Double movement speed while holding a key:

( Name="NumPadSix", Command="SloMo 2 |  OnRelease SloMo 1" )


Unlimited ammo and grenades on Reload:

( Name="PC_Reload", Command="SwapWeaponIfEmpty | TryReload | initammo 999 | initgrenades 10")


To upgrade your current weapon to the SuperGun (9999 ammo / ultra-high damage):

( Name="F4", Command="givesupergun" )


To upgrade your current armor's damage protection:

( Name="F5", Command="givesuperarmor" )


For God Mode:

( Name="NumPadZero", Command="God" )


For no Power Cooldown period:

( Name="NumPadZero", Command="ENABLEPOWERCOOLDOWN 0" )


Note:  Both God Mode and Power Cooldown effects reset every time you lose control of Shepard (cutscenes) and need to be re-enabled.


FlyCam[]
The flycam allows you to detach the camera from the player and fly around the map. It can be used to view normally inaccessible areas of the game or to set up screenshots from alternate angles. To make the flycam work properly you have to set up the following command...

( Name="F9", Command="ToggleFlyCam" )
Replace "F9" with a key of your choice.
in the following directories...

Bioinput.ini/sfxgame/sfxgamemodedefault
Bioinput.ini/sfxgame/sfxgamemodeflycam
Toggling the flycam during conversation mode will not allow you to move or look around unless you add the following commands (one line for each command) to Bioinput.ini/sfxgame/sfxgamemodeconversation

( Name="MouseX", Command="PC_LookX" )
( Name="MouseY", Command="PC_LookY" )
( Name="A", Command="PC_StrafeLeft" )
( Name="W", Command="PC_MoveForward" )
( Name="D", Command="PC_StrafeRight" )
( Name="S", Command="PC_MoveBackward" )

Making the "T" Key Available[]
By default, you're not able to remap the "T" key using the in-game options menu.  To allow "T" to be remapped, look in each of these four sections:

bioinput.ini/sfxgame/sfxgamemodedefault/00000409/localizedbindings=(multiple)
bioinput.ini/sfxgame/sfxgamemodedefault/0000040c/localizedbindings=(multiple)
bioinput.ini/sfxgame/sfxgamemodegui/00000409/localizedbindings=(multiple)
bioinput.ini/sfxgame/sfxgamemodegui/0000040c/localizedbindings=(multiple)
and change the "T" in the entry: 

"(Name="T", Command="PC_Talk")"
to whatever key you would like to use as the new multiplayer communication key  (this key will then become unbindable in game.)




Launching commands from an external batch file[]
The batch file trick for executing multiple commands that worked with Mass Effect 2 will also work with Mass Effect 3. You can assign a key to execute a text file and in-game it will run whatever command in the text file through the console. Doing so makes it easy to change console commands on the fly by alt-tabbing and saving a new command into the text file.

( Name="NumPadNine", Command="exec powers.txt" )
Note: : the powers.txt file in this case should be placed under Mass Effect 3/Binaries folder, along side with MassEffect3Config.exe.

Editing Powers[]
This section is for information on adding / editing powers.
You will find the list of all the available powers in the game here:

[Biogame.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxpowercustomaction]

Unlocking Bonus Powers[]
All available bonus powers can be found here:

 bioui.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxgamechoiceguidata > storedata > bonuspowers > storeitemarray
Remove the PlotUnlockConditionalID=XXXX or set XXXX to -1 on the desired powers to unlock them.

Alternative method:
A more apt option will be to replace the XXXX of desired power with XXXX of a power easily/already unlocked.

Example:

One may edit the reave power to become-
(ItemType=TYPE_POWER,PlotUnlockConditionalID=1281,BaseCost=3000,ItemClassName="SFXGameContent.SFXPowerCustomAction_Reave",ChoiceEntry=(srChoiceName=314878,srChoiceDescription=314879),Priority=9,BaseCost=5000,LargeImage="gui_codex_images.Store.STO_BonusPower_512x256",SmallImage="GUI_Icons.Notifications.NT_Store_256x1286")

XXXX originally was 1276 but here it is replaced with 1281, allowing it to be unlocked along with fortification (unlocked after one good long paragon conversation with Mr. Vega), see Powers (Mass Effect 3) for reference.

Note:  Some users report the correct number to use for Vega's conversation to unlock bonus powers is 1282, not 1281.


To change the cost of switching bonus powers, go here:

[bioui.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxgamechoiceguidata > storedata > bonuspowers > storeitemarray]

From here, change BaseCost=5000 to the value of your choice.


Temporarily Adding Any Power[]
There is a simple method to add any power to your character; however, all talents which are NOT Bonuspowers will be removed every time another save game is loaded or mission start. Just keep checking your active powers and hitting the Num Pad button you bind. On the other hand, Bonuspower talents (Carnage
Marksman
ProximityMine
Decoy
ProtectorDrone
EnergyDrain
InfernoGrenade
Reave
Stasis
WarpAmmo
Barrier
GethShieldBoost
Fortification
ArmorPiercingAmmo
Slam
DarkChannel) will stay after load or mission start. You can add all bonus powers at once and they won't disappear. 
Go into bioinput.ini...

 bioinput.ini > engine > playerinput > bindings
copy and paste the following string into a blank line on the right of the editor

 ( Name="NumPadFour", Command="givepower self cryoammo" ) 
Simply change "cryoammo" to any power name [most correct names have no space, should be straight forward for all powers]
The command's effect will add a talent to your character with the first level already active. You can add as many powers as you like. Simply copy and paste into a second blank line, and change the Num Pad number key being targeted as well as the power itself).

Make Powers Penetrate Cover[]
In coalesced.bin,

biogame.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxpowercustomaction > 

For many, though not all, of the powers listed here, there is an attribute that includes the statement:

BlockedByObjects=true

If this is currently set to true, changing it to false will cause any radius effects of the power to ignore cover, making the power hit enemies behind cover.  Note that this does not make the deployment of the power succeed if hitting cover would cause it to fail - i.e. it won't make your Pulls and Throws penetrate cover, even if set, but it can make your Nova (listed as discharge here) hit enemies behind cover.
In addition, some powers also list this statement, usually in the same line:

ImpactPlaceables=true

If set true, this will cause the power to hit Cerberus Engineer turrets.  If false, it will either bass through the turret and ignore it, or simply give an error and not allow targeting, depending on the power in question.  Most powers with this attribute are already set properly, but in some cases this can still be useful to change, such as setting some powers that are more effective against the Engineer himself to false will allow you to target him with the power directly, even if he's behind the turret.
NOTE: ImpactPlaceables may affect something besides Cerberus Engineer turrets, but nothing else is yet known.

Zero Squad Power Cooldown Time[]
In coalesced.bin,

biogame.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxpowercustomaction > 

This is a list of all powers in singleplayer. If a power has the following attribute:

henchmancooldowntime = (basevalue=number, some other irrelevant data)

Then it is useable by a squadmate. Change the number value to .5 for an almost instant recharge. The lower the number, the faster the cooldown.

Edit Power Combo Damage/Radius/Force[]
In coalesced.bin,

biogame.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxgameeffect > powercombo > biotic

These are the attributes that control the damage, force, and radius of biotic combo explosions.  Editing for tech bursts is in the other nearby sections, namely cryo, electric, and fire.  Editing the values here appears to change the damage, force, or radius for detonating one rank 6 power with another rank 6 power.

Make powers penetrate shields/armors[]
This will allow you to use throw (or  any other moving power) on enemy that has any armor like "armor" "shield" etc.
Go to Coalesced.bin,

biogame.ini > sfxgame > sfxgameconfig

In line bShieldsBlockPowers set value to "false"

Editing Weapons[]
Unlimited ammo[]
Go into bioweapon.ini > sfxgame > sfxweapon . Change the relevant variable into the one below. Default value is false.

binfiniteammo = true

For bottomless clip/no reload, 

ammopershot = 0

To change it back, default value is 1.
Certain weapons (like the N7 Hurricane) have a special parameter for the ammo per shot. You'll have to find them using the method described below and edit their particular value.


Changing Zoom Level[]
Go into bioweapon.ini > sfxgame > sfxweapon .
aimmodes = (ZoomFOV= , ...)

Lower FOV will zoom in more. EG, Default value for sniper (ZoomFOV = 10) is more powerful than a scoped SMG (ZoomFOV=22).


Individual weapon tweaks[]
If you want to change the stats of an individual gun, such as fire rate, damage, or recoil go to

bioweapon.ini > sfxgamecontent > sfxweapon

From there you can open up the files for each weapon which are broken up into sections based on weapon type.
Here are some editable attributes.

Accuracy
maxaimerror = (X= , Y= )
minxaimeror = (X= , Y= )

X and Y fields should be the same. Bigger values mean less accurate. The above two values fix accuracy when not holding down right mouse, or aiming. "zoomaimerror" is for accuracy while aiming.

maxzoomaimerror = (X= , Y= )
minzoomxaimeror = (X= , Y= )

Crosshair size
maxzoomcrosshairrange = (X= , Y= )
minzoomcrosshairrange = (X= , Y= )

Crosshairs DO NOT scale with accuracy. It is up to you to fix the cross hair size to fit the accuracy that you have modded.

Recoil
recoil = (X= , Y= ) 

This is for recoil when not aiming. Bigger means more recoil.

zoomrecoil = (X= , Y= ) 

This is for recoil while aiming.

Damage
damage = (X= , Y= )

X is value of weapon damage at level I, while Y is the damage value at level X.
Note:  Make sure you also fix the statbardamage attribute to be the same values as the damage that you set. There are two other values for stat bars: accuracy and rate of fire. These two values don't correspond with the values that actually affect the behavior of the gun.

Rate of fire
rateoffire = (X= , Y= )

Both X and Y values should be the same.

Weight
encumbranceweight = (X= , Y= )

Value x is the weight of the weapon at level I, and value Y is the weight at level X. For example, a weight of 1.4 means your cooldown will be slowed by -140% if you equip this weapon.



Customized weapon mods[]
To modify the mods usable by each weapon go to

bioweapon > sfxgame > sfxweapon > weapon type > base

and edit the allowableweaponmods field.
Example: Adding SFXGameContent.SFXWeaponMod_SMGMagSize to SniperRifle unlocks the SMG Heat Sink to the list of possible mods for the sniper rifle.

Customizing squad member loadouts[]
biogame.ini > sfxgame > sfxplayersquadloadoutdata > henchloadoutinfo

then change the appropriate henchman's line.
Example: Change

(ClassName=SFXPawn_Tali,WeaponClasses=(LoadoutWeapons_HeavyPistols,LoadoutWeapons_Shotguns)) 

to

(ClassName=SFXPawn_Tali,WeaponClasses=(LoadoutWeapons_AssaultRifles,LoadoutWeapons_HeavyPistols))

Tali's weapon set is now assault rifles and heavy pistols.
Note:  Squadmates are only allowed to equip up to 2 weapons. Trying to mod them to take on more will be useless since selecting their weapons in the HUD ingame would only allow for 2.


Disable Enemy Grenades or Change Grenade Frequency[]
You can change the frequency that grenades are thrown (both smoke and frag) by changing the difficulty level configuration in Coalesced.bin. This setting is per difficulty level, per enemy type.
In a Coalesced editor, open:

biodifficulty.ini > sfxgame > sfxdifficultyhandler > level5difficultydata

Difficulty level range from 1 to 5, where "Insanity" is 5. The example above, level5difficultydata is for insanity. Choose the one you want to modify.
Next, choose the enemy type of modify. In this case, Centurion. Find the section that reads StatName=SmokeFrequency,StatRange=(X=1f,Y=2f), and change the x and y values. The higher the number, the less often they will use smoke grenades. You can also change GrenadeFrequency in the same way.


Editing Armor and Casual Appearance[]
This section is for customizing armor and appearances and the bonus stats.
All armor and appearances can be found here: [biogame.ini > sfxgame > sfxplayercustomization]


Unlocking Armor[]
armappearances - Arm
helmetappearances - helmet
legappearances - Leg
shoulderappearances - Shoulder
torsoappearances - Torso
fullbodyappearances - Non-component armor
To unlock, set the PlotFlag for the armor that you want to -1.
Example:

(Mesh=(Male="BIOG_HMM_ARM_SHP_R.SHPa.HM...lthBonus"),Id=0,Name=339526,Description=339527,PlotFlag=-1,Type=CustomizableType_Arms)



Editing component armor bonuses[]
List of all component armor bonuses:

"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_HealthBonus"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_AmmoCapacityBonus"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_MeleeDamageBonus"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_PowerCooldownBonus"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_PowerDamageBonus"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_ShieldBonus"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_ShieldRegenBonus"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_WeaponDamageBonus"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_ConstraintDamageBonus"
Each gives a 10% bonus to that stat.
Note:  ConstraintDamageBonus is headshot damage bonus. Adding _Weak to the end after Bonus will halve the effect to 5%.

For this example, the arm piece of the N7 armor (the first item on the list) is edited to become this:

(Mesh=(Male="BIOG_HMM_ARM_SHP_R.SHPa.HMM_ARM_SHPa_Slv_MDL",Female="BIOG_HMF_ARM_SHP_R.SHPa.HMF_ARM_SHPa_Slv_MDL"),GameEffects=("SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_HealthBonus","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_AmmoCapacityBonus","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_MeleeDamageBonus","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_PowerCooldownBonus","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_PowerDamageBonus","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_ShieldBonus","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_ShieldRegenBonus","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_WeaponDamageBonus","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_PartBasedArmor_ConstraintDamageBonus"),Id=0,Name=339526,Description=-1,PlotFlag=-1,Type=CustomizableType_Arms)

This piece will now contain EVERY bonus stat available. Copy-paste the GameEffects terms into other armor pieces to give them all stats.

You can also add these effects to the "No Helmet" component if you prefer to play that way.


Editing complete armor set bonuses[]
Complete armor sets (non-component) can also be tweaked this way. The bonus stats for these armors are below and can be added to all armor in the same method as adding to the components above.

"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_BloodDragon"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Cerberus"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Inferno"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Reckoning"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Tank"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Terminus"
"SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Collector"

For this example, all custom armor powers are added to the Inferno armor that is inherited from ME2:

(Mesh=(Male="BIOG_HMM_ARM_SHP_R.FBDa.HMM_ARM_FBDa_MDL",Female="BIOG_HMF_ARM_SHP_R.FBDa.HMF_ARM_FBDa_MDL"),GameEffects=("SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Tank","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Inferno","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Cerberus","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Terminus","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Collector","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_Reckoning","SFXGameContent.SFXGameEffect_UniqueArmor_BloodDragon"),Id=0,Name=711024,Description=711025,PlotFlag=20988,Type=CustomizableType_Torso)

These effects do appear to stack in-game.


Changing Armor Appearances[]
Go to [biogame.ini > sfxgame > sfxplayercustomization]
The default line for the armor's helmet appearance:

(Mesh=(Male="biog_hmm_hgr_shp_r.SHPa.HMM_HGR_SHPa_MDL",Female="BIOG_HMF_HGR_SHP_R.SHPa.HMF_HGR_SHPa_MDL",bHideHair=True),Id=0,Type=CustomizableType_Helmet)

Changing the mesh reference in the line so that it would look as follows:

(Mesh=(Male="biog_hmm_hgr_shp_r.SHPc.HMM_HGR_SHPc_MDL",Female="BIOG_HMF_HGR_SHP_R.SHPc.HMF_HGR_SHPc_MDL",bHasBreather=True,bHideHead=True,bHideHair=True),Id=0,Type=CustomizableType_Helmet)

This would result in the armor using Death Mask helmet model, complete with the flanging effect when Shepard speaks.
Removing the mesh reference completely in the line so that it would look as follows:

(Id=0,Type=CustomizableType_Helmet)

This results in the helmet mesh being removed, leaving Shepard without any headgear. Neither modification alters the armor bonuses in any way, and is purely cosmetic.


Unlocking Casual Appearances[]
Go to [biogame.ini > sfxgame > sfxplayercustomization > casualappearances]
To unlock, set the PlotFlag for the armor that you want to -1.
Example:

(Mesh=(Male="BIOG_HMM_ARM_CTH_R.CTHl.HMM_ARM_CTHl_MDL",Female="..."),Id=9,PlotFlag=-1,Type=CustomizableType_Torso)



Adding a new casual appearance[]
Go to [biogame.ini > sfxgame > sfxplayercustomization > casualappearances]
Copy the last line to a new line and replace the Male and Female parameters' with the name of the new mesh.
Next, set new Id field (make sure, it's not a existing id) to add this new outfit.
Example:

(Mesh=(Male="biog_hmm_arm_nkd_r.NKDb.HMM_ARM_NKDb_MDL",Female="..."),Id=10,PlotFlag=-1,Type=CustomizableType_Torso)
