Description[]
The krogan surveying team that first reported back from Maldor said, in characteristic understatement, that the planet had "a bit of the good stuff, if you can get past a little acid." Although Maldor's mineral wealth includes uranium, iridium, and other heavy metals, miners must contend with crushing gravity and atmosphere, boiling temperatures, and clouds of sulfur dioxide. As such, once the planet's most accessible ores were depleted, the mining interests that exploited the planet quickly departed.
