Geth Repair Drones are the geth equivalent of a battlefield medic, repairing any damaged soldiers or recharging their shields.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Geth Repair Drones are deployed by the geth that Matriarch Benezia brought to Noveria. These small flying drones are encountered by Shepard and the squad at Peak 15. They assist the geth that ambush the squad when they enter the garage. 

Tactics[]
While they don't have any offensive weaponry, their ability to repair their more powerful cousins makes them a great threat. Make sure to take them out first before focusing on the other geth. Using Overload and Sabotage against them is a good idea as they are synthetic enemies. Also because they are flying enemies, they are immune to most biotic abilities.
