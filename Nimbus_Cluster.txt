Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II (Mass Effect 3)

The Nimbus Cluster lies in Outer Council Space, near the outer edges of the Milky Way. Asari interests dominate the region, home to small colonies and mining operations and no significant mentions of lawless activity. As with many places in the galaxy, however, the Reapers have begun assaulting the cluster's meager worlds and infrastructure.
