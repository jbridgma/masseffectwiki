Description[]
The system's only gas giant has rings laced with the faintest traces of element zero dust, likely from an extrasolar asteroid pulverized by a collision with the planet's moons. Collecting and refining the eezo in dust form is a long and costly process. The Elkoss Combine sought the mineral rights to Egalic from the matriarchs on Thessia, but the Reaper invasion stopped any deal from going through. The equipment here is undamaged by Reapers--the attack on Niacal likely taking priority.
