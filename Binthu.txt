Description[]
Binthu has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, with a permanent haze of toxic chlorine and clouds of sulphur dioxide that periodically drop torrents of acidic rain on the surface. Its crust is mainly composed of sulphur with deposits of calcium.
Like most worlds in the Voyager Cluster, Binthu has only been charted within the last 20 years by Alliance surveyors. It has no known native ecology. Data about the world is surprisingly brief and generic, painting a picture of an unpleasant and uninteresting place.

Properties[]
The operational area has a bumpy terrain. Navigating to and from all points of interest will be time-consuming due to bumpy uphill drives while trying to keep the Mako stable.

Trivia[]
Binthu's moon is the same asset as the one used to represent satellites on the skyboxes of Klensal, Amaranthine, Ontarom, Eletania, and Feros (original version of Mass Effect only).
Despite the in-game description claiming Binthu has no known native ecology, in Mass Effect Legendary Edition its terrain now features 3D grass carpeting instead of plain brown textures.
