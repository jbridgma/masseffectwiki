This page refers to a project BioWare once worked on which was eventually scrapped. It is preserved here for archival and reference reasons.

For the military unit, see Corsair.
Mass Effect: Corsair was a cancelled first-person space-travelling simulator[1] for the Nintendo DS.[2]
According to former BioWare executive Mark Darrah, players would have taken control of an independent Han Solo-type character, piloting a vessel around the lawless frontiers of the Milky Way doing missions and exploring along the veins of Privateer and Star Control. It would have featured ship combat[3] as well as forays into batarian space. BioWare was able to put together the beginnings of a flight control system before the project was abandoned.
Development was stopped for several reasons, though primarily due to economic infeasibility. Due to its size the game would have required the most expensive type of cartridge for the DS, at $10.50, and would have retailed for $30, though with Electronic Arts' projections that it would only sell about 50,000 copies it was determined that the profits wouldn't be enough to cover the costs. Additionally, BioWare couldn't quite figure out how to fit the game's space travel mechanics with established FTL lore.
The team working on Mass Effect: Corsair eventually splintered off to different directions. Some moved to BioWare Montreal, others went on to develop Mass Effect Galaxy and Mass Effect: Infiltrator.
