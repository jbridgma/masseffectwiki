“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




Lair of the Shadow Broker[]
After being given new data about the Shadow Broker by Commander Shepard, Liara T'Soni contacts Sekat and tasks him with narrowing down the Shadow Broker's possible location. Sekat manages to trace the Shadow Broker's base of operations to a specific system, and Liara plans to meet him at his office in the Dracon Trade Center. 
Later, the Dracon Trade Center is attacked by the Shadow Broker's private army to quash the information leading to the Shadow Broker's location. Sekat is cornered and killed in the attack by a Shadow Broker Agent, shortly before Commander Shepard arrives on the scene.
