Description[]
Farthest out from Teyolia, Atebolos is a low-density planet peppered with outdated mining facilities and a few independent mechanical contractors. The unmanned mining scouts that first surveyed the planet conveyed positive reports, based on the light gravity, gentle atmospheric pressure, and easily penetrable crust of silica and salt. Neither methane pockets nor low temperatures were barriers to the asari, but after centuries of mining, the veins of genuinely valuable minerals are gone and all but a few inhabitants have departed.
