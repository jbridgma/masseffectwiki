Eclipse Vanguards are the biotic and close quarters specialists for the mercenary organization Eclipse. They are exclusively human and asari with the latter being the most predominant due to the asari's naturally increased biotic potential and power. The Vanguard's role is to close in and eliminate opponents with sheer force and power.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Asari Vanguards are armed with the M-27 Scimitar, which is limited in range, but has a bonus to damage versus shields and barriers. Their combat behaviour is to engage the enemy at point-blank range, but unlike the larger geth units or the Krogan Berserker, Eclipse Vanguards utilise cover during their advance.
Human male Vanguards use M-15 Vindicators and attack from range.
Both variants have the Warp power to complement their armament. 

Defensive
Eclipse Vanguards possess the rarer biotic barrier protection. As such they are resistant to powers and ammo that are effective on shields such as Overload and Disruptor Ammo. They are additionally protected by Tech Armor.

Tactics[]
On harder difficulties, Vanguards are a nightmare to face in close combat, and the recommended tactic is to keep the Eclipse Vanguard at a distance. Ideally, they should be taken out at long range as they try to close in on you.
Powers such as Warp, Concussive Shot and Reave are effective against barriers, as are assault rifles and Submachine Guns with their innate damage bonuses.
As one of the most dangerous class of Eclipse mercenaries in a given group, it is advisable to concentrate firepower on any advancing Eclipse Vanguards.
Asari Vanguards will call out before using Warp: "Weakening their integrity!" "Deploying Warp field!" or "Mind over matter!"
Combat Drones can only distract enemy Vanguards briefly as their shotguns usually eliminate them in one shot.
Flashbang Grenade can disable their biotic attacks but the weapon overheat effect does not last very long against shotgun-wielding opponents.
When their barriers are very low or depleted, Vanguards can use their Tech Armor to fully replenish them, so be sure to get them off their feet or otherwise disable them before they have a chance to do this.
