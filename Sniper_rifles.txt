This article is about sniper rifle weapons in Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3, and Mass Effect: Andromeda. For the talent in Mass Effect, see Sniper Rifles (talent). For the skill in Mass Effect: Andromeda, see Sniper Rifles (skill). For other uses of sniper, see Sniper.


Sniper Rifles are one of the primary weapons in the Mass Effect universe. Used for long-distance combat situations, sniper rifles are generally equipped with targeting scopes, sport longer barrels, and pack a higher damage per round than most other weapons but at the expense of reduced firing rates and overheat allowances.

Mass Effect[]
Sniper Rifles refers to both a type of weapon and its corresponding unlockable combat-oriented talent, available to Soldiers, Infiltrators, and the Turian Agent. The talent increases accuracy and damage with sniper rifles, and grants the Assassination ability.
Sniper rifles are slow and usually overheat after two shots in quick succession. However, they make up for this in range and damage - higher-level sniper rifles retain accuracy at incredible ranges, and they will often kill weaker enemies in one shot. Beware, though; close-range encounters are not recommended, due to the fact that you will more than likely miss any shots in close combat. To counter this inaccuracy at close range, kneel but do not zoom in, and then fire when the reticle turns red.
Tapping the "use" button ("E" on the PC) will zoom your view. It should be noted that the close-in view from a sniper rifle makes an excellent telescope, useful for scouting out enemies at a distance whether you fire at them or not.
Sniper rifles have a rate of fire of 0.6, i. e. one shot every 1.67 seconds.

Mass Effect 2[]
Sniper rifles are powerful, long-ranged weapons with built-in scopes. In contrast to the other standard weapon types, none of the sniper rifles in Mass Effect 2 possess any sort of short-range damage bonuses, but on the flip side none suffer from any damage falloff at long range. All sniper rifles can be fired in a scoped mode during which Shepard's vision is zoomed. During scoped mode, sniper rifles will place bullets on the crosshair with 100% accuracy; firing non-scoped shots on the other hand is highly inaccurate, especially out of cover. While attached to cover, all shots will automatically be fired in scoped mode. 
Taking fire or being damaged will usually not cancel scoped mode unless Shepard is stunned or staggered (e.g. being hit by an enemy power or melee attack), but taking damage will cause the crosshair to shake, making precise aiming more of a challenge. Using any powers while scoped can allow them to lock on to targets farther away than normal targeting allows and with greater precision, but this also usually disrupts the position of Shepard's crosshair severely. 
At the start of the game, sniper rifles are available only to the Infiltrator and Soldier player classes. Other player classes can choose to train in sniper rifles later in the game. The following squadmates utilize sniper rifles: Garrus, Legion, Thane, and Zaeed.

Mass Effect 3[]
Sniper rifles are on the heavier side of the weight spectrum, but they can provide players with accurate and powerful long-range firepower. Typically, the less damage per shot done by a sniper rifle, the higher its rate of fire. 
All sniper rifles possess a scope, allowing them to fire with pinpoint accuracy when the scope is used; however, this comes with the downside that most sniper rifles are both less accurate and less damaging when fired unscoped. It is also difficult to hit targets at close range while scoped, especially if they move erratically. Like assault rifles, sniper rifles can also be modded with more advanced scopes that can detect invisible enemies and see through smoke and objects. 
The player does not gain additional accuracy when firing a sniper rifle from cover while scoped, but firing from cover does grant additional shot stability, which also reduces the disruption to aim that occurs when taking hostile fire. Also, it isn't possible to leave cover while looking through a sniper rifle's scope.
Along with SMGs, sniper rifles cannot be modified to improve the user's melee damage.
The following squadmates utilize sniper rifles: Ashley, Garrus, and Zaeed.

Sniper Rifle Customization[]
Sniper Rifles can be customized by two different methods in Mass Effect: Andromeda. 

Weapon Modifications[]
Main article: Mods
Mods are customizations that are exclusive to weapons only in Mass Effect: Andromeda. Mods use round-shaped sockets on a weapon and can only be changed at a Loadout terminal.

Weapon Augmentations[]
Main article: Augmentations
Augmentations are semi-permanent customizations to crafted weapons or armor in Mass Effect: Andromeda. When a weapon is created during Development (crafting), hexagonal-shaped sockets are available to add augmentations to the weapon. These augmentations cannot be changed like weapon Mods and stay part of that weapon until it is deconstructed.
