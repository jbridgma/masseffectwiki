The Tavetaan is the angaran equivalent of a pub on Aya. It serves drinks and food in the form of nutrient paste. It is a popular spot for recreational activity.
The word "tavetaan" refers to either an old friend or a place to bring someone home to. In angaran linguistics, it is perfectly acceptable to "bring one's tavetaan to the tavetaan."

The tavetaan bar has vats of nutrient paste in addition to bottles of liquid ingestibles. It is staffed by three servers, one of which is Roaan Aabel. Nakmor Drack and Liam Kosta often lounge here during visits to Aya.
Toward the north is a balcony with a few windowside tables for dining and viewing the vista beyond. Down the set of stairs to the west are more seats for patrons as well as a backdoor that leads to the middle area between the Marketplace and the Governor's Office; ambient angaran music can be heard by the door. The large door northeast of the bar opens up to the area that leads to either the Repository of History or Resistance Headquarters.
The area south of the bar is not actually counted as part of the Tavetaan, but the Holographic Message Terminal there counts for some purposes.

The Resistance Needs Volunteers

Translated from Shelesh:

The kett have felt the power of the Resistance, and they know their end is coming. Our victories on Voeld are only the beginning of what we can achieve, but we can't defeat the enemy without your help. If you're tired of living in fear, if you believe we were meant for something greater than slavery, if you're willing to stand up and fight: you'll find a new family in the Resistance. We'll train you to strike back at the kett and reclaim what is ours.


The Resistance defends the future of all angara. Join us.
