Items[]
Eight different gift items are available for purchase upon first arriving at the Citadel. Which gifts are available depends on whether Ashley Williams or Kaidan Alenko is present. If Ashley is the patient, all items except for the TM88 Peruvian Whiskey are available. If Kaidan is the patient, then only the TM88 Peruvian Whiskey is available.

Flowers
A large and fragrant bouquet of flowers, grown in the Citadel's hydroponic gardens.

Candy Assortment
A deluxe selection of chocolates, hard candies, and caramels. Warning: These sweets are suitable only for levo-amino acid-based life-forms.

Rumi: His Remembrance
The works of Rumi, a 13th-century Earth poet, have been continuously in print since the 20th century. This edition of his poems was created a few years ago to mark the 900th anniversary of his death.

Tear-songs of the Plains
Avant-garde poetry by the infamous elcor performance artist Nockrick Taur. Critics agree that while Taur employs striking imagery, his verse structure suffers from an undisciplined laziness.

And Love Fell
A book of free verse by reclusive asari poet Techllis Bel. This sharp, pessimistic satire questions the ability of sentient races to rise above basic bloodshed. It's been a bestseller for decades.

Among the Multitude
A collection of verses by Walt Whitman, a 19th-century Earth poet. A percentage of each purchase goes to the Whitman Foundation, a charitable organization that provides hospital care to those who can't afford it.

The Collected Alfred Tennyson
This volume of poems by Alfred Tennyson is a newly released edition that was printed in extremely limited quantities by Oxford Press. This version is highly sought after by book collectors.

TM88 - Peruvian Whiskey
Tasty yet Medicinal -- The Perfect Gift
Smooth and smoky with a hint of heat, each sip of TM88 has a story to tell, and each glass has a story to inspire.
TM88 isn't one of the Earth's top-selling beverage exports for nothing. Known for having both a calming influence and the ability to stimulate blood flow, TM88 is the only alcoholic drink endorsed by the Medical Board of Sur'Kesh.
The price for TM88 includes deposit. Please recycle.

Trivia[]
The fictitious "Whitman Foundation" that provides hospital care mentioned in the description of the "Among the Multitude" poetry collection is likely in reference to Walt Whitman's actual work tending to wounded soldiers in hospitals during the American Civil War.
