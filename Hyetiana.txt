Description[]
Hyetiana serves as a bastion of research for the asari, boasting multiple observation outposts, glacial drilling stations, and educational institutions. While the planet's average temperature hovers near freezing, the equatorial band contains oceans and many fresh-water rivers. Xenobiologists of all stripes often visited the planet, as its expansive facilities were a haven for the life sciences.
The Reapers destroyed Hyetiana's spaceports and its uniformed defense forces. As with other asari planets, the Reapers forced the heavily biotic population into surrender through threats of massive retaliation rather than assault by husks alone.
