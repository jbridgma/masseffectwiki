Description[]
A dwarf planet, Gotha has a pressure-cooker atmosphere that brings its surface temperature to a scorching level. Carbon dioxide and ethane are plentiful in the planet's hazy atmosphere.
There has been speculation in the mining community about whether all of the precious metals were mined by the quarians before they fled the system some three centuries ago. Rumors abound that anyone who could brave the geth in the system could find lodes of naturally occurring diamonds on Gotha, but this is likely just a starship legend.
TRAVEL ADVISORY: Gotha is in geth space. All civilian traffic is prohibited.

Trivia[]
Gotha is likely named after one of the two capital cities of the former combined duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (the other being Coburg), which was ruled by the now-defunct House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from 1826-1918.
The House is still the ruling house of the UK and Belgium in the present day (as the House of Windsor and House of Belgium, respectively).
