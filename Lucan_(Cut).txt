Mass Effect (cut)


Lucan is a character cut from Mass Effect that would have been part of the deleted assignment Global Plot 1. He was going to be present on the Citadel until Shepard came along.
Lucan is a so-called Void, a human experimented on by the biotics company Nexxus. After escaping from it with Lysander Kostas, he stayed for a time with him at the MindTech company on Noveria, where Lysander tried to remove his brain-damaging implants. However, Lucan's paranoia had progressed too far and he fled with other Voids, by convincing them Lysander was going to do something terrible.[1] The group ended up on Feros where Lucan's brother Dorian enlisted the help of Horace and other mercenaries to keep them hidden and safe. But Lucan became too unstable once again and left on his own, which is how he eventually ends up on the Citadel.[2] After learning of his location, Lysander tries one last time to get him back by sending Jered Salenta.
After meeting Jered, Shepard is told to go see Lucan in an alley by the black markets in the Citadel Wards.[3] He is found demented, muttering to himself and demanding some quiet. He repeatedly mentions a "path" leading back to his friends on Feros.[4] When Shepard does what Jered instructed and tells him Lysander can help, Lucan becomes erratic and attacks Shepard's squad in a paranoid fit. After he's dead, his dropped datapad eventually leads Shepard to Horace and Dorian's camp on Feros.[5]
