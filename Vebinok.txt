Description[]
Vebinok is a small terrestrial world with a thin atmosphere of krypton and xenon. Its frozen surface is mainly composed of carbonaceous material, water ice, and low-density silicates. Rare but concentrated lodes of light metals have been deposited by asteroid impacts.
One hemisphere of Vebinok is covered by surface deposits of oxidized copper. Approximately 270 years ago a turian bulk gas transport was attacked by pirates in the Phoenix system. Damaged, it made a rough landing on Vebinok. The heat of the landing melted significant quantities of surface ice, and ruptured shipping containers spilled LOX across the surface. Before this evaporated and escaped Vebinok's weak gravity, it reacted to cause the widespread rust.

Properties[]
On the assumption that a thin noble-gas atmosphere this far from the sun is a negligible greenhouse and undergoes negligible chemistry, the planet's albedo comes out to −2.5. The atmosphere probably has more carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone than the description admits, and with more internal heat – perhaps a result of the accident.

Trivia[]
Pinnacle Station's command deck offers an impressive vista of Vebinok, and shows that the planet has several rings.
