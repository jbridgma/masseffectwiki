Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Toggling Hunter Mode on or off, while using Tactical Cloak, counts as using a power and will break cloak.
Hunter Mode creates a visual overlay on your Heads Up Display (HUD) akin to Devastator Mode.
Strategies
This power can be confusing and may distract from actual targets at first; it is suggested to keep it constantly turned on for a few missions, in order to get used to the visual noise on screen.
Hunter Mode can be respectively turned on and off when trying to locate enemies, cloaked or otherwise. Care should be taken since it does count as using a power and as such, stops your ability to use other powers (like Tactical Cloak or Overload) during the cooldown.
The Geth Scanner causes an User Interface (UI) effect similar to that of Hunter Mode.
Caution should be observed when using Hunter Mode as it reduces shielding, since at best, geth characters are left with around 863 points of shields, or, at worst, 375. This makes geth very brittle.
It may be necessary to take cover more often while the power activated, since most enemies will swiftly kill regardless of difficulty. When it is not in use, the character returns to its normal durability level.
The Geth Trooper Soldier can largely compensate for the shield reduction of Hunter Mode with the 40% damage reduction from Fortification.
