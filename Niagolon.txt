Description[]
Niagolon is a hydrogen-helium gas giant. The Reapers have destroyed its fueling infrastructure.
During the Lusia campaign that started the Krogan Rebellions, Niagolon was the site of krogan Overlord Kredak's ultimate defeat. As his flagship was discharging its drive core and undergoing repairs, an asari commando team snuck on board and detonated resonant warp bombs, sacrificing their lives to destroy the vessel through explosive decompression.
