During the initial Reaper invasion of Earth, FCC News reporter Emily Wong managed to secure a Quantum Entanglement Communicator (QEC) from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). With it she was able to live-cast the opening hours of the Reaper invasion via the Alliance News Network despite the Earth communication buoys having been disabled by the Reapers. The information capable of being transmitted by the QEC was limited to short burst messages, some of which were garbled by interference. Each message was appended with the tag #solcomms, as it was assumed to be the only communication with the Sol system during the invasion.

Thank you for bearing with us. Earth is currently experiencing a comm buoy outage. #solcomms
Hi, everyone, this is Emily Wong with FCC News. Apologies for text-only feed! #solcomms
Talking with Dr. Leisha Martinette at UCLA, using QEC -- quantum entanglement communicator. #solcomms
QEC faster than light, but can only talk to matched particle. Also limited to text. Yay typing! #solcomms
This QEC talking to asari space near Trikalon. With comm buoys out, only way to talk offworld. #solcomms
Loss of comm buoys huge financially. All of Earth cut off from Extranet. Still not sure why. #solcomms
Dr. Martinette says could be environmental, not necessarily sabotsdfasiofhd
<SIGNAL LOSS> #solcomms
Back, sorry, just had minor quake. Knocked out power. QEC now hooked to portable cell. Back in business! :) #solcomms
Emily Wong, FCC News, here at UCLA trying to find reason for Earth's comm buoy outage #solcomms
Just been told need to see something outside. Hang on. #solcomms
Something in skyline. Not cloud. Ship maybe? Red lights. #solcomms
Seems too big for ship. Like Godzilla was 100mtall, 150 in holo remake. This 10x that. #solcomms
Has six legs. Tentacles? Maybe 2-3 km to east, over Wilshire skyway. And I mean OVER it. #solcomms
Can see an eye or something. That red light I mentioned is among the tentacles. #solcomms
This is Emily Wong back online at UCLA on Earth. Unknown alien ship just landed nearby. #solcomms
Sorry for break. Ship made loud blare/roar, big like rock concert. Could feel in chest. This thing can't be friendly. #solcomms
Alarms in skycar lot all going off again. No broken windows not this far off anyway. #solcomms
People coming outside to look now. Big crowd on campus. Some still in pajamas. Lots of people running. #solcomms
Now that tentacles extended, recognize this. Looks like geth flagship that attacked the Citadel. #solcomms
This is why the comm buoys were out. #solcomms
It just moved. Lifted a leg. Could be coming this way. #solcomms
Need to move, will try to take QEC. Dr. M says can't. Back soon. #solcomms
Emily Wong, back online. Taking QEC to report on ship, UCLA-PD Officer Aidan Pearson coming with us to guard it. #solcomms
Putting QEC on little mass cart to try to get it into the company skyvan. Back soon. #solcomms
Okay, this is Emily Wong, on air, in air. Pearson is driving. Dr. M is sitting shotgun. #solcomms
For those just joining. Earth's comm buoys out. Massive geth flagship in Southern California likely cause. #solcomms
Swarms of skycars are careening out of air lanes, trying to get away from it. #solcomms
Van GPS out. Omni-tool GPS too. Looks like sats down? If so, act of war. #solcomms
We're flying over the groundcar freeways -- we're going to have to use them to navigate. Airborne over the 405 now. #solcomms
Groundcar traffic is thick. Rubbernecking at the giant ship. Lot of idiots driving skycars badly up here. #solcomms
Dumped camera gear -- not much good now. Gained some altitude. Mushroom cloud to the northeast. #solcomms
Pearson says mushroom cloud near Fort Irwin. #solcomms
Aliens here to kill us all? Doesn't make sense. They would have hit downtown. Maybe they're just targeting the military? #solcomms
Dr. M is trying to call Pearson's wife on her omni-tool. Phone network is down, no doubt overloaded. #solcomms
Cresting hill into San Fernando Valley right now. Lot of smoke from Van Nuys Earth-local airport. #solcomms
Meteorites or something dropping from sky onto airport tarmac. They're smoking. People coming out. #solcomms
Wait. Not people. Moving in closer. #solcomms
Aliens look deformed, lumps on back. Not like krogan, whole upper body bulbous[80er. #solcomms
Aliens hitterminal with energy weapon whole bldg destroyed. #solcomms
This is Emily Wong, FCC News, reporting on alien attack on Earth. Currently fleeing Van Nuys airport. #solcomms
No pursuit, nobody hit. Aliens have guns as well as energy weapons but are on foot. Pearson circling back to freeway. #solcomms
Trying to report on routes out of LA, but have to dodge incoming skycar drivers from north and south. #solcomms
They're coming at us head-on, same altitude. Everyone scared. Plz drive safe everyone. #solcomms
OH GOD EVERYONE FLEEING LA DO NOT GO NORTH ON 405. SOMETHING ON ROAD #solcomms
Another ship/thing standing over freeway. Not as big as other one, but still big, maybe 200m tall.#solcomms
Firing beams, destroying skycars. Made holes in freeways. DO NOT APPROACH #solcomms
Spikes on side of road. Tall -- Vlad the Impaler spikes. Saw similar ones when geth hit Citadel during Saren's attack. #solcomms
Spikes hung with human bodies. More of the lumpy aliens dragging people toward them. Hundreds of them. #solcomms
Some lumpies shooting people. Others taking people alive. Need to get out of here, firing into air too #solcomms
Get out. Get out if you can #solcomms
This is Emily Wong reporting via QEC on the alien attack on Earth. We are back online and okay. #solcomms
We didn't get hit. It must not have wanted us too bad. QEC took a bump during the dodge, Dr. M saved it. #solcomms
Still in Valley, staying low. Smaller fighters/drones over mountains firing at any skycars that approach. #solcomms
Big metal bug is still at the 405 choke point. DO NOT APPROACH OR GET OUT OF VEHICLE #solcomms
Officer Pearson is very concerned. If aliens targeting civilians, he believes his wife at home could be in danger. #solcomms
Trying to figure out where to go next. Emily Wong with FCC News, back soon. #solcomms
For those of you just joining us, Earth is being invaded. Alien forces are exterminating all resistance. #solcomms
I'm Emily Wong, FCC News, with Dr. Martinette and UCLA-PD Officer Pearson, planning next move. #solcomms
Dr. Martinette and I have no family on Earth. I have coworkers in San Jose, but not sure how to reach them. #solcomms
Pearson's family is in Inglewood. So that's where we're going. #solcomms
Only good thing about giant death machines is you can see them a long way off. Can see one burning LAX now. #solcomms
We're staying off big roads, blending in with buildings and ground clutter. Near Pacific Palisades. Sat radio out, will try AM. #solcomms
AM radio still on. Someone calling invaders "Reapers." #solcomms
Radio says Alliance dreadnought shot down over Vancouver. I thought they couldn稚 [sic] go in-atmosphere? #solcomms
Pearson says he has spare guns at his house. Can only help, but looking at thing firing on LAX, not sure pistol will do it. #solcomms
We're at Pearson's apartment block. Time to meet the family. #solcomms
Change of plans. Pearson's wife left a note. Their son never made it home from high school. #solcomms
Buses are all ground-only, students may be trapped. This skycar just became a rescue team. #solcomms
Officer Pearson loaned pistol. He's also got a vest and a UCLA-PD kinetic barrier for himself. Hope we don't need them. #solcomms
Reached the school. Can see an open-air basketball court filled with spikes. Humans penned in by lumpies. #solcomms
Landing now. Pearson and I will get close. Dr. M will be getaway driver. Going dark, will be back online soon. #solcomms
Oh god pearson dead full thermal clip into alien and it still killed him before it died #solcomms
Got weapon from pearson's target but backup arrived, had to run #solcomms
I'm sorry I'm so sorry we tried but we couldn稚 #solcomms
This is Emily Wong. Officer Pearson died trying to save students at his son's school, one of countless such heroes. I'll be back. #solcomms
More news on the aliens. When Officer Pearson downed one, another ignored me and bent over its comrade. #solcomms
As best I could tell, it was eating the fallen alien. Unfamiliar with any similar cannibal activity among known aliens. #solcomm
Dr. Martinette believes it would help to discuss the alien weapon I recovered. We're safe now, pulling over. #solcomms
The weapon is a meter long, more curves than a human rifle. Smooth organic feel but it's metallic. #solcomms
Parking structure nearby. Going to fire weapon at wall. Dr. Martinette will study effects. #solcomms
sry weapon hot brnd hands. Aslo hard t see. Bright violet blast destryed wall big hole. #solcomms
She has theories. Micro black holes, fusion reactions, nuclear force, all put into rifle. Going to my place to find food, plan. #solcomms
This is Emily Wong, reporting on alien invasion. They池e attacking civilians and penning us in the cities for some reason. #solcomms
Apologies for poor typing earlier. Hands burned. At home. Have gotten medi-gel and doing better. #solcomms
No water pressure. Long-term, will be deadly. Without water in Los Angeles, you dry up and die fast. #solcomms
Motivation for attack still unclear. Would surrendering lead to mercy, or would they put us on spikes? #solcomms
It's still not clear what these Reapers want. Not to kill us -- could have used nuclear weapons. #solcomms
I can only hope the rest of the galaxy is hearing this message and planning a counterattack and rescue. #solcomms
Not even clear what they are. Cannibals are clearly not geth. Four eyes like batarians, but some kind of cybernetic implants. #solcomms
Dr. M searching pages on offline sources. Confirming spikes used in attack on Citadel. People turned into "husks". #solcomms
Have gotten food, feeling better. Reaper "horn" blaring, making it hard to think. #solcomms
Dr. Martinette says klaxon may have infrasound frequencies to cause instinctive fear reaction. It works. #solcomms
Or maybe this is just a mistake, like First Contact War. #solcomms
If Reapers came thru batarian space, could think we are allied with them. Need to communicate with them. #solcomms
This is Emily Wong. We're safe now after a near encounter with creatures Dr. M calls husks. Almost thought they were people. #solcomms
Had holes in their stomachs from spikes. Glowing light inside. Only way I could tell at distance that they weren't people. #solcomms
Skin was gray, no hair, no clothes. Dr. M suggests chilling theory on why Reapers here now. #solcomms
Cannibals have batarian features. Repurpose batarians into cannibals, use as shock troops to attack Earth. #solcomms
They make husks from humans, attack turians. Make something from turians, attack asari. Turning our civilians into their troops. #solcomms
I have a theory. We're heading to the van. West Hollywood has prison. Will be back with findings shortly. #solcomms
Emily Wong back with you. Theory was right. West Hollywood prison quiet, but field of spikes in prison yard. #solcomms
Reapers know where to get bodies. No coincidence. Must have been monitoring communications for years. #solcomms
We're going to check Cedars Sinai. Another large group of potential victims with little ability to resist. #solcomms
Cannibals and husks all around hospital. Can't get close -- looks like theory was accurate. #solcomms
Dr. M brainstorming more locations. Churches? Popular in disasters. Not sure. #solcomms
Please, if you hear this, DO NOT GO TO ANY INSTITUTION WHERE PEOPLE GATHER. THEY ARE TARGETS. #solcomms
Oh, no... Dodger Stadium. Game today. #solcomms
This is Emily Wong broadcasting from a rooftop near Dodger Stadium. It's now Reaper territory. #solcomms
Husks outside, but not tens of thousands. May not be finished converting victims. #solcomms
Can see cannibals dragging people from cars, marching them into stadium. #solcomms
There's Angelinos of every age, men and women, dressed blue-collar or fancy, some bloody, most just terrified. #solcomms
Marching like POWs, but these aren't soldiers. They're just people who got captured during their morning commute. #solcomms
Can't get into stadium, but no doubt in my mind it's filled with spikes. #solcomms
This isn't how humans are supposed to die. We beat nuclear war. We beat overpopulation. We can't go like this. #solcomms
This is Emily Wong. Earth is falling. #solcomms
Can see shuttle taking off from El Monte Airport. Alien fighters moving to intercept. Shuttle not going to make it. #solcomms
Wait! Anti-aircraft tracer fire coming from the airport. Covering the shuttle. Alien fighters down! #solcomms
We've got to get to this airport. First sign of real human resistance! Back online shortly! #solcomms
Met w/Lt. Col. Gordon Soto of National Guard. Were at the airport this morning, fully equipped when it all went down. #solcomms
He said to keep getting the message out. I just got hugged and high-fived by about a dozen grunts. #solcomms
Everyone glad msg getting out. Workers and travelers still scared, but hope to escape. #solcomms
Hang on, I see fighter drones approaching. Guard manning guns on tarmac. #solcomms
Radios dead. Guard asking us to get away from windows, lie flat. Can hear klaxon of big Reaper ship coming. #solcomms
Can't just lie here. If we die, QEC dies and Earth goes dark. I'm getting it to the van. #solcomms
Alliance ships overhead! Jets and gunships! Trinities and Mantises! We've got a counterattack! #solcomms
Gunships holding line at the fence. Shooting at cannibal and husk ground troops. Cannibal blast just took out gunship #solcomms
We're in van. Buckling in everything and everyone. Dr. Ms got the energy weapon. Maybe can help #solcomms
Alliance forces have not hurt Reaper ship. No damage. It's coming straight for us. Straight for ME. #solcomms
This signal, going out and being rebroadcast everywhere I think they picked it up. I led them here #solcomms
To everyone I may have endangered, I am so sorry. I can only hope the information we got out is worth it. #solcomms
Trying to lead it away. Huge glowing red eye opening. No not eye, gun, it's firing #solcomms
Airport gone. Eye is Reaper ship's big gun. Alliance ships hitting from behind, no damage. Jamming tech, many shots missing. #solcomms
Dr M taking us in. Our Reaper weapon might be only way to damage ship. Flying low. #solcomms
Oh god weapon not firing only had one shot were being targete72-r3 #solcomms
hit bullets from ground lots blood dr m dead hurts god im hit too #solcomms
Van still flying. Lost a lot of blood. Not sure how long I have. Not sure QEC even still on. #solcomms
Reaper out in front of me. Lost pistol. Only weapon left is this skyvan. #solcomms
Fighter drones closing. Gunships are down. Mom, dad, love you. #solcomms
Go on. Make your noise. Try to scare us. #solcomms
You want to see how a human dies? At ramming speed. #solcomms
<SIGNAL LOSS.> #solcomms
