Nonya Tombiri is a character who was cut from Mass Effect. She was the human administrator in charge of the Caleston mining station Throw Down.
Tombiri lived on Earth in Dakar until the age of 6, when she and her parents moved off-world. She was eventually appointed administrator of Throw Down, a mining station on the planet Caleston, for the Eldfell-Ashland Energy corporation who owns it. After Shepard arrives in search of Liara T'Soni, she claims the asari is being held by Smiley.[1] Despite her apparent cooperation, that is later revealed to be a convenient lie to get the Spectre to get rid of the leaders of the Cartel. As the secret leader of the rivaling Union, the destruction of the Cartel was meant to allow her full control over the mining station.
Eventually, if Shepard does end up dismantling the Cartel, Tombiri will provide T'Soni's real location at Knossos as thanks. If not,  then Tombiri will want to make a deal: she will only reveal T'Soni's location if Shepard doesn't turn her in. If Shepard has already obtained the location from Smiley, she has nothing left to bargain for, and Shepard may directly decide if Tombiri is under arrest, or allowed to continue running Throw Down. If Shepard did not obtain the coordinates prior, then the Commander may accept the deal, or use Charm, Intimidate, physically assault Tombiri, or have her beaten up by either Ashley Williams or Urdnot Wrex to get them. After that, Tombiri may again be left alone, arrested, or left to die if she was beaten up.[2] If left alive, she can be subsequently found in either her office or in Jason Harrah's jail depending on Shepard's decision, but will only say brief comments without engaging in active conversation.[3]
News reports heard on the Citadel later mention Tombiri's demise and her connections to the Cartel if she was arrested or eliminated; if Tombiri was left in charge, she reports that the "Caleston Cartel" has been brought to justice, a bit of news which pleases the Eldfell-Ashland corporation.[4]

Trivia[]
If Nonya Tombiri was sent to Harrah's jail, when interacted with inside her cell, she could sometimes be heard singing Louis Armstrong's song Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen.
As BioWare developers have cited Caleston's cut storyline as a major inspiration for Mass Effect 2's Omega, one can notice a more-than-passing resemblance to Omega's Aria T'Loak as they're both ruthless female leaders who desire complete control over their mining station and the crime rings on them.
Several sets of data indicate "Buhari" was an alternative name for Tombiri during development.[5]
