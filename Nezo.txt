Description[]
Agebinium is a small terrestrial world with an extremely thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide and krypton. Though the planet has sufficient mass to maintain a much thicker atmosphere, much of it has been blasted away.
The red giant Amazon is a long-period variable star, currently at the nadir of a 16-year cycle. At peak, its energy output doubles, lashing Agebinium with intense heat and radiation.
The crust is mainly composed of aluminum with deposits of tin. Much of the surface is coated with fine silicate dust, which easily penetrates the smallest cracks to foul machinery.

Discovery

Charred corpse

“Brushing away the carbonization on the door of the contragravity speeder, you see the Nezo brand name.  Judging by the charring, the wreckage has been here since the star's last variable peak.  The corpse is wearing the remains of an expensive suit, and what appear to be melted antique aviator goggles.”

Properties[]
Agebinium's operational area features a moderate breeze that can impact visibility. Although a significant swathe of terrain is relatively flat, most points of interest are on mountainous regions.

Trivia[]
"Nezo" (the brand name on the crashed speeder) is an anagram for Enzo.
