For more specific information on primary missions, see Mass Effect: Andromeda Guide.
Missions in Mass Effect: Andromeda are clearly organized into five subfolders in the journal: Priority Ops, Allies and Relationships, Heleus Assignments, Additional Tasks, and Completed Missions. 
All missions are placed in Completed Missions after finishing them. If the other subfolders have no more missions available, they are then grayed out and inaccessible unless another mission appears through game progression.
