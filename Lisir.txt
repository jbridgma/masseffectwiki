Description[]
Lisir is a low-density world notable for its appearance in the asarisploitation holo, "Blue Steel," one of humanity's first attempts to market entertainment galactically. The promotional campaign assured viewers that it was "filmed on location in the most dangerous section of the galaxy, the Terminus Systems!" In fact, the cast and crew were relatively safe, occupying a space station that orbited an unremarkable, lifeless planet.
Lisir's space stations housed a largely asari crew teleoperating robo-mining of uranium. When "Blue Steel" was released, human audiences still thought of this as an exotic profession. Today, it would induce yawns.
The Reapers have destroyed the orbital stations around Lisir and have moved on. It is not known if anyone managed to escape.
