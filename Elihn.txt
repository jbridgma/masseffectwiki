Elihn is one of the curators of the Repository of History on Aya. She and fellow curator Nalon help their boss Avela Kjar with her studies. She specializes in data encryption.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Elihn was previously an engineer. Moshae Sjefa once requested her help cracking the encryption on a Remnant ship, which eventually led to her employment in the museum.
When Pathfinder Ryder visits the repository, Elihn can ask if it was true that they entered a vault on Eos. She finds it amazing and wishes she'd seen that.
Elihn finds it strange to be working for someone as young as Avela. Her boss is too passionate for her own good and Elihn has to remind her to rest every now and then.
Elihn can be overheard reporting to Avela about a number of topics. A shipment from Havarl never showed up, which is attributed by her boss to the increasing difficulty in crossing the Scourge. She's having difficulty decrypting ancient angaran data, deeming it nearly impenetrable, and Avela suggests taking it to the Moshae.
After the discoveries at Khi Tasira, Elihn can be found talking to Nalon about Avela's behavior. She muses Avela spent her life trying to understand the angaran past, only to learn it was created for them.
