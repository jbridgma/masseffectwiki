Description[]
Several attempts to chart Matol have been made, but none have been successful. By normal standards a small rock planet, Matol has a dense atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide and argon, with a surprising amount of water vapor. Fogs and rain are common on the barren, lifeless surface.
Matol is pleasant enough to be considered a terraforming prospect, though its low mass and high radiation from the energetic blue star Herschel place it fairly far down on the list.
