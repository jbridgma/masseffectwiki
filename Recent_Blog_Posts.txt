The end of an era


So I was digging out my watchlist and talk recently, and reminescing on my misspent youth all those years ago editing guides and stuff around here. When I came across this discussion where it was noted Temporaryeditor78 fell afoul of recent policy changes.
It's not really my place to comment on the thread directly, I'm really but an outside observer and I'm not looking to make a stir, but I thought it was worth writing some notes about, because it has to be said, TE did a lot of work over the years. Nearly 30k edits is nothing to sniff at. He made large contributions to the consistency of the wiki and the upholding of a consistent MOS, which is something of a rarity in wikispace these days. The fact that he was still consistently editing wh…

A few clarifications


A few clarifications regarding Mass Effect 3:

I played ME3 many times from beginning to end, more than I care to count.  I played ME1 and ME2 too, but it was only a long time ago and not nearly as much as ME3. I don't play MP, though, as it feels like an unrelated different game.
There is no right or wrong way to play any game, however, if an achievable goal is set under certain constraints, there must always be more optimal (right) and less optimal (wrong) ways to achieve that goal.  For example, in a chess match, if the goal is set to lose, not to win, then every otherwise wrong move now becomes right, and the otherwise worst move (if it exists) becomes the very best.  In a game like ME 3, if the goal is set to merely experiment with diffe…

Talking the Talk: A Look at Dialogue in Mass Effect: Andromeda


This is a review I wrote for an assignment way back in April. I found it on a USB recently and decided to post it here. Enjoy. Or Don't. Either-Or.

Mass Effect: Andromeda is the latest role-playing game to be developed by BioWare. Five years after the last entry’s release, Andromeda invites players to return to the immersive world of space battles, blue alien babes and interstellar exploration that first arrived on shelves back in 2007.
The game opens with humanity’s first entry into the titular galaxy. After six hundred years in cryogenic storage, the player’s character, the male or female Ryder, awakens to find the golden worlds they sought to colonise damaged beyond habitability and is then tasked with finding a new planet to call home. The …

Missing Squad Member On EOS


I'm At the point in the game where I am clearing radiation and it requires me to go 2 other "Alien Bases" and fight the "observers and bots" but when I get to the second base they are no where to be found. I have restarted my game and even loaded an earlier manual save and they are there in the rover with me to the second base but after we get to the base they are no longer there. I have used the command to bring them by my side but nothing. What should I do?

Over 95 hours and not close to finishing (no spoilers).


Sooooo..... I expected the scale of Mass Effect: Andromeda to be a little larger than the first Mass Effect, having read about it before the release.
How wrong I was.
Mass Effect: Andromeda is immense in every sense of the word. As a completionist, I'm almost disheartened when I look at the cluster map, asking myself, "Another 2-3 golden worlds to explore every nook and cranny, with seemingly with no end in sight?". I believe the major contribution to this feeling is the daunting number of tasks the game has to offer. One article recommends focusing on the main story missions first which I did... to some extent. Despite trying to focus on the main missions, I can't shake the feeling that I need to clear out existing assignments and tasks, be…

The Facial Animation 'Scandal'


All over the internet it seems that much of the criticism of Mass Effect: Andromeda seems to fixate on the poor facial animations. Are the animations poor? Yes, they are, and I think even animators at BioWare would agree with that. I do think the amount of criticism is excessive and I think the fixation on it makes it tough to find and honest review, but I don't think it's unfair. Mass Effect has long been known for its storytelling, and when the faces of those telling the story aren't convincing, it really harms the ability of players getting into the storyline. 
I do think that a shortcoming of this magnitude is inexcusable. While some animators have said that it is because of improved graphics and players becoming more adept at seeing poo…

videos, page headers and other Andromeda-driven updates on the wiki


as people may or may not know, we have been working behind the scenes with Fandom staff in anticipation for Mass Effect: Andromeda. here's the PSA on what's been happening, and your comments are actually solicited for research purposes.

ME:Andromeda Reviews


It's the day before release and the reviews are starting to roll in:
Gamespot: 6/10
IGN: 7.7/10
GameInformer: 8/10
Polygon: 7.5/10
PC Gamer: 80/100
The common criticisms seem to be that there are technical issues, they don't like the supporting characters, and they feel that there aren't enough "big decisions". 
I feel that reviewers have gotten into the habit of overplaying technical issues. I find that often they are playing on a non-final build, and naturally those builds have less polish. Essentially, if they don't keep the game from being fun, they should affect the score too much. It seems that the penalties given here were pretty harsh.
We'll see about the supporting characters. I do think it will be hard to beat the original series in t…

Cards Against Humanity - Mass Effect edition


Yes, you read that correctly. It's not a fan-made deck of cards like you see online. It is a legit, honest-to-god official expansion made by the CAH people. And that's not the craziest part.
Do you know what is?
The URL. Care to guess?
It's totallyfuckablealiens.com. You couldn't make it up. And for a cheap price of US $1 (barring light taxes), you can get this CAH expansion easily.
There has been a whole lot of information. Expect to see--

Could the Andromeda Initiative have planned a way to return to the Milky Way Galaxy?


The stated goals of the Andromeda Initiative are to not only explore and establish permanent settlements on the "Golden Worlds" of the Heleus Cluster, but also to establish a reliable route between these colonies and those in the Milky Way Galaxy. So will the Nexus and/or Arks be sent on another 600 year-long integalactic journey back, to report the Andromeda Initiative's success to the Citadel Council? (assuming Shepard didn't refuse the Catalyst's options and the Citadel races succeeded in ending the cycle of the Reapers' "Harvest") Or will the Andromeda Initiative construct its own mass relay to connect the Heleus Cluster to the Milky Way's relay network? (not implausible, as the protheans constructed their own mass relay, the Conduit, …

Fandom Wikias are for Admins only...


I would like to address an issue going on with the administrators retaining quality control over the wikia to the extent where I simply can't make an edit without an admin subjecting it to rollback. I've been a major fanatic of the Mass Effect franchise (for the epic space opera that it is) for over five years but as an editor on this wikia I've constantly been treated like a total stranger to the point that it simply feels like living a police state. I even considered dropping out time to time, but this is the only wikia I know that's completely dedicated to all things Mass Effect. Am I to keep referring to you admins for quality assurance over my edits?

What We Know So Far VI - N7 Day 2016 and GameInformer



1 Introduction
2 Trailer
3 Game Infomer
4 Misc. Info


I have no words...
No. Wait. I'm wrong. I have some words to say. First off, let me start off with some good news. That's what this blog is all about, in light of the US election: the good news. A whole slew of information about Mass Effect Andromeda over the past few days.
N7 Day happened on Monday, November 7, 2016. With it came the cinematic trailer everybody has been waiting for. Here's my breakdown:

An arc ship mysteriously breaking down as her crew tumbled around. Some were sucked into space. The male Ryder screamed and fell as the ship crashed into an unknown planet. As this happens, Alec Ryder says, "We slept for hundreds of years... dreaming of a new home. But when we finally awoke, our dreams…

What We Know So Far V - 4K Tech Video and Other Information


It's here. Some gameplay footage of the upcoming Mass Effect: Andromeda. If you ever have any feelings of excitement or ecstasy, don't worry. It's only natural you feel that way. In fact, I'm fairly certain more people are here for that than the Playstation 4 Pro.
That's not all. In an interview on Playstation Access, we don't play as a single protagonist whose gender we select at the start, we have two protagonists--a brother and a sister. Not only that, do you remember the N7 soldier from the E3 2015 trailer? Yep, he's their father. One big happy family, right? Knowing BioWare, they'll probably pull off something like Fallout 3 and 4, having one of the siblings and/or the father killed for the feels. Along with that and some dad jokes. The…

ME Trilogy Remaster likely a no-show


On September 1, 2016, Peter Moore have ruled out against remastering their games, including Mass Effect. He claimed that they would rather move forward with their upcoming games, with remasters distracting from that.
Womp womp.
Do note that this was quoted before Patrick Soderland's interview regarding the potential for a remastered version.
UPDATE: Now EA are considering making a remaster after a lot of demand from the last interview.

Why Andromeda?


Not that I think it isn't a good place to continue Mass Effect at. I'm just wondering, if the Milky Way peoples were able to build an intergalactic sleeper ship, why not first explore the satellite galaxies closest to the Milky Way, such as the Magellanic Clouds? I'm just saying our of curiosity. But I can imagine the Local Group being explored as a whole someday, if they wanted to do it.

About these Andromeda books...


First of all, all the reports that came out in late June said that the first of the Mass Effect: Andromeda books was to come out sometime this month. Has anyone found anything as far as an exact date? I've searched various online stores and I can't seem to find anything as far as it being on sale yet. The best source I've found, the publishers rights guide @ http://media.titanbooks.com/filebrowser/2016_rights_guides_fiction_libf1.pdf just says August 2016. Also, something interesting is that the title of the book on the cover graphic does not match the stated title Mass Effect: Andromeda Initiative. This could indicate that the name changed at some point, or it was simply a mistake. According to this guide, the book is 336 pages long and i…

The BioWare Social Network is shutting down


As of today, BioWare will be shutting down the BioWare Social Network, or BSN for short, on August 26th. It will be in read-only mode until October 25th. BSN is known for a lot of things, such as being a fan community with some esoteric elements, like people finding out what Tali's sweat smells like (no, I'm not making it up). While most fans met with each other there, some are disappointed with the closure while others are content or pleased with the news.
If you're wondering how much of a cesspool BSN is, you can check out Something Awful's article on it.

"What packs should I buy?" is by far the most common question asked in the ME3MP communities I frequent, followed closely by "People still play this game?!". The answer to the latter is very simple ("Yes"), the former being less straightforward. Since there are nearly a thousand Rare and Ultra-Rare item cards alone, you have an extremely slim chance of unlocking a specific item you want – especially if you're not willing to go through the hassle of only having the DLC pack contain…

Ultimate Infiltrator Sniper guide ME3


With the correct selection of skills, weapons and mods, the Infiltrator not only becomes the most lethal sniper in the game but possibly the most lethal class in general, based mainly on how quickly they can make groups of things they don't like become dead and simultaneously rarely receive damage. The Soldier can be focused to be a decent sniper, it's just that the Infiltrator will be a lot better at it, and every other class and build have key aspects on how they fight that a sniping Infiltrator can surpass.

In mid to long range weapon combat without sniper rifles, other classes with other weapons need to fire multiple shots into any target, even weak ones, in order to kill them. At these ranges they often can't get the critical headshots…

Ecological Issues Within the Mass Effect Universe


Greetings to all of you. 
I had no idea as to where I could post such a topic/discussion, and so I found this blog. I'm hoping that I can post it here, if not, just remove this post please. I am in need of your help. I am currently doing my Master's in Comparative Literature and I have a course called "Ecocriticism, Ecology and Environmental Humanities". Hence, in this course, I need to discuss the ecological issues in any piece of work, such as novels/movies/series and even videogames! (cool huh?). 
Since I LOVE the ME universe, I thought that I could tackle the topic through one of my favorite games. Hence, I am asking you, do you remember of any major ecological issues (I'm thinking about Quarians, for instance. I will definitely use th…

The mod adds in ten of the powers that appeared in Multiplayer to the single player mode ala bonus powers that Shepard can get after getting the Normandy when you start a new game or during an old save. Unlike most other mods, it doesn't the require ME3 Explorer, the multiplayer DLCs, nor the ME3 Console. All you need to to is to drag the files "DLC_CON_BPPack1" and/or "DLC_CON_BPPack2" folders into your Mass Effect 3 DLC folder (Mass Effect 3\BIOGame\DLC). But it does require the WarrantyVoider's DLC Patch, which you can get it here. You can get the mod here.

Transfer saves


OK so, whether it belongs to the forums or not, I have no clue. Anyways, this is a question I want to ask. Is it POSSIBLE to transfer my Xbox 360 saves to the PC? Ever since I got all 3 games on PC, I don't have all the DLC and because the DLC play such a crucial role in the game, I want to make sure my Mass Effect is played in the best possible experience but thing is...to get all the DLC, I have to go to Bioware, find the dlc's, buy them and latrer download them which I personally find annoying. Now I played all 3 games on the Xbox first and I got basically got all the DLC's. 
Back to the question, is it actually possible to transfer my Xbox saves onto the PC?

I'm sure there's quite a bit of people that do wonder what's currently known about the next Mass Effect game. I'm here to sum up all the news and rumors that's been floating around the web the past 2-3 months about the next Mass Effect game.
The first thing that’s known about the next game is that the support for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 is being dropped, as a way to benefit the actual gameplay of the next Mass Effect game. Also, it was stated that Dragon Age: Inquisition will not be a template for the next Mass Effect game either. All of this was stated on the internet community Neogaf by the Bioware executive Aaryn Flynn.

Indoctrination Theory Theory


Yes, yes, I know, hear me out.

I eagerly, though somewhat tentatively, await the next installment. I've heard from various sources that they plan to take the next part of the series in a whole new direction and with new staff leading the way, all of which cause me concern owing to the parallels they draw with some of our generation's most disappointing continuations of long-lauded artistic works.
