Kadara
To: Ryder
From: Vetra

Ryder,
Don't worry, Sid didn't do something reckless. This time. As far as I know.

I've just found something cool on Kadara. Wanna meet me there? I'll send the navpoint as an attachment.

Go with Vetra to the Sulfur Springs on Kadara[]
With Vetra in the active squad, travel to the navpoint  located in the Sulfur Springs area.
This is a short and peaceful mission; it contains only cutscenes and dialogue (and up to two interrupts; the interrupt while climbing has no influence on the mission or dialogue).
If you have flirted with Vetra before and Ryder isn't already locked in a romance, it is possible in this mission to lock the romance with her or to reject her.

Rewards[]
None
