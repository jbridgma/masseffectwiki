A cluster firmly within the Terminus Systems, the Hourglass Nebula remains largely remote despite being a relay stopover between Omega and Illium on their respective clusters. A significant number of its worlds have been named by salarian explorers who found either barren rock or lucrative robo-mining opportunities.

The Hourglass Nebula is a nebula approximately 8,000 light-years away from Earth in the Musca constellation. Discovered in the early 20th century, the co-discoverers Annie Jump Cannon and Margaret W. Mayall listed this nebula for the first time in the Henry Draper Catalogue as MyCn18.
The Hourglass Nebula is a mission location in the N7 HQ Galaxy at War mini-game for Mass Effect 3.
