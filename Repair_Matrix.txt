Player Notes[]
Grenade powers do not have a recharge time and, thus, can be used immediately at any time, provided grenades are available. Using the power consumes one grenade each time.
If the player has multiple grenade powers, the grenade pool is shared between them.
The number of charges is dictated by grenades carried, so equipping a gear that will increase grenade capacity will boost the number of charges for this power.
This power does not revive the user if hit with a sync kill.
Note that Repair Matrix does not work the same way as medi-gel.  For Repair Matrix to revive you, it has to be active before you are downed; you cannot activate it while you are down.
