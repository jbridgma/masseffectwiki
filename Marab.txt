Appearances
Mass Effect 2


Marab is a friendly-natured salarian customer service representative who is employed at Saronis Applications. 
He is a great admirer of Commander Shepard and is one of the few individuals to recognise the Commander without prompting. Manipulating him into offering a discount is markedly less hostile compared to other similar conversations with other vendors, as he will be deceived instead of directly confronted or coerced. 







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




Marab is also in possession of the volus Kor Tun's credit chit, helping to resolve a dispute between the volus and a quarian bystander.
