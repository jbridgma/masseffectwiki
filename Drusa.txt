Tag Natanus debris for removal on Havarl[]
Follow the 9 navpoints. Six of them are clustered around the Central Wilds region and three are in the Chasm of the Builders. When you come upon debris - multiple grayish-black slabs of metal on the ground - scan it. Each group of debris awards +10  (+90  total). Also aiding in visibility, some of them lie beneath lootable containers.
As this is an open world task, be prepared to face all kinds of roaming Roekaar, Remnant bots, or wildlife while looking for the debris.
