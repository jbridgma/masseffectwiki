Background[]
The bar becomes open for business once Pathfinder Ryder sets up Prodromos on Eos. It was originally a chemistry lab, but people kept bringing in furniture and other things until it mutated into its present form.

Layout[]
The Vortex is a single large room with what appears to be three fair-sized fermenting vats against one wall and a semi-circular bar surrounding a gigantic vat. Additionally there is a small stage, dance floor, ample tables, and seating for patrons.
As Ryder establishes outposts across Heleus, settlement flags begin to appear behind the bartenders' counter.
