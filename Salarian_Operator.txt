Support expert that repairs shields and hacks enemy hardsuit defenses.
Badgered into volunteering for the Initiative by his father, the Salarian Operator isn't quite sure why these APEX people think he can actually help them, and would really rather be working on tech at an outpost site. But if he's here, he'll try to make the best of it.

General Notes[]
A support character designed to strip enemy defenses, the Operator has Overload to destroy shields and Invasion to undermine armor. Combined, they can wipe whole squads off the field, even at higher levels. Just beware, the Operator has relatively weak defenses that need to be bolstered regularly by Shield Boost, and is often overwhelmed by close combat.
