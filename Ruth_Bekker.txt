“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Ruth Bekker can be found in the Badlands of Kadara.
Ruth has a highly contagious, cross-species disease called TH-314, which remained dormant while in stasis until her nephew Charlie woke her up. Charlie falsified records to allow Ruth to join the Initiative even though she had this deadly disease that disqualified her. 
If Ryder responds to Captain Nozomi Dunn's request for aid on a sensitive matter, Dr. Harry Carlyle explains to the Pathfinder that one of his medtechs, Charlie, had secretly snuck his aunt, Ruth Bekker, onto Hyperion, past Initiative screening processes.
Ryder's search leads to Kadara, where it is discovered that angara are immune to TH-314 and Ruth has been captured by the Roekaar, who plotted to use the virus. Ryder sends Carlyle this information in hopes of eventually creating a cure or at least a vaccine.
