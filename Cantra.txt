Properties[]
Based on size, distance, and lack of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere the calculated albedo is −6.9. Nothing can explain this discrepancy except a mistake in the readings.

Trivia[]
In Mass Effect 2, this planet is shown as "Cantra" as opposed to Canctra.  It is unknown why the spelling differs between the games.
