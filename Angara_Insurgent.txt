Master of holding one location with traps and localized support.
These kett invaders need to back off of the Angara Insurgent's territory. Seriously. These new aliens fighting with him might be useful, but someone needs to show them how things work in this galaxy.

General Notes[]
Trip Mine and Assault Turret allow the Insurgent to hold large areas of the map while focusing on shooting. It is a good idea to stay mobile and regularly replenish and rearm your mines.
Trip Mines are best placed in tight areas with high traffic, or directly in enemy spawn points, where they can kill entire squads of low-level troopers they instant they spawn.
