This article is about the location in Mass Effect: Andromeda. For the system in Mass Effect, see Acheron.

Acheron Spine is a vaguely-defined region in H-047c. It is described as such due to little differentiation between itself and unmarked surrounding regions. Its most distinctive features are a group of craters with small geysers inside that periodically erupt, as well as a giant rock that apparently lodged in a crater. To its west is the Lethe Rift, to the northeast is Cocytus Plateau, and far to the south after unmarked terrain are Crater: Peregrine and Crater: Vespasien.
At the base of the giant rock is a basic mining zone.

Trivia[]
Acheron is the river of woe in the underworld of Greek mythology.
