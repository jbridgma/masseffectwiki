Mass Effect[]

Asari Scientist is a non-playable class in Mass Effect.
The Asari Scientist is primarily focused on biotic power, though the Electronics talent, unlocked from First Aid, can increase shield strength as well as provide some ability to overload enemy shields and access secure objects and systems. Both an omni-tool and a bio-amp may be equipped. The class lacks any special weapon training.
Legendary Edition:  The bonus to First Aid recharge times has been significantly improved, with an increasing rate of return from talent points invested.
Warning: If all of Liara's abilities that are actively usable in combat are unlocked, the Overload ability icon becomes hidden in the HUD. This occurs in all versions of the game, despite changes in the HUD design. The player will only be able to benefit from Liara's Overload if the Squad Power Usage option is set to "Active" allowing her to use it without being explicitly ordered.
