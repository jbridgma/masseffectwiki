Description[]
Carried by the batarian military's notorious Special Intervention Unit, the Raider is a semi-automatic shotgun that loads slowly but fires rapidly, with tremendous force. Short-range even for a shotgun, the Raider has a large pellet spread. Rather than eliminating recoil, its integral compensators instead make it predictable and vertical.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
The AT-12 Raider was initially available as a bonus item on PC to players who pre-ordered Mass Effect 3 on EA's Origin service.[1] An e-mail from James Vega appears when obtaining the weapon in this fashion. 




New Shotgun


Hey, Commander:

Ever try out the AT-12 Raider? It's a shotgun. Hell of a kick. Can punch a hole through almost anything. Some contacts I made on Omega a few months back are shipping a crate out to the Normandy. My treat.


James



It was later available on-disc of the Wii U version[2], and eventually for all platforms in Mass Effect 3: Leviathan. It can be found on a corpse during Namakli: Leviathan near the first group of enemies encountered.

Multiplayer
The AT-12 Raider is randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs.[3] The AT-12 Raider is categorized as rare and requires no multiplayer expansion packs.

Player Notes[]
GeneralSingle-playerMultiplayer
General
The AT-12 is a two-shot shotgun whose main strength is its very high firing rate. This, coupled with its very damaging shot (nearly as powerful as the M-11 Wraith's), makes it well-suited to popping out from cover to fire off a quick burst of two shots to take out an infantry target or deal heavy damage to larger targets before returning to safety to reload. This two-shot burst can deal more damage than the single shot of the M-300 Claymore.
The Raider has high recoil, so a practiced user will be ready to compensate for the crosshair-climb of the first shot before firing the second.
Generally, when attacking infantry targets the first shot should be carefully aimed to be as on-target as possible, with the second shot saved as insurance in case the first shot is not fatal.
The AT-12's major weakness is its wide pellet spread, making it almost useless except at very close range.
The spread pattern of a Raider shot is ovoid with none of the eight pellets firing towards the center of the crosshair.
The Shotgun Smart Choke does produce a fairly noticeable decrease in crosshair width, making the weapon effective at slightly longer ranges, but it will not fundamentally change the Raider's nature as a close-range weapon.
The Raider's spread shape and width make it impractical for landing headshots except at point-blank range.
The Raider, like all conventional shotguns, suffers very little damage loss from shield gates and so is very effective against shielded infantry; however, it will deal very little damage to armored targets like Brutes especially on higher difficulties unless mods like the Shotgun High-Velocity Barrel or the Shotgun Shredder Mod are equipped, certain ammo powers/ammo bonuses are used, or enemy armor is weakened by powers such as Warp or Cryo Blast.
Adrenaline Rush's instant-reload function can be exploited to fire off four shots in quick succession for extreme burst damage. This can quickly take out medium or hard targets even on higher difficulties.
Due to the Raider's low extra thermal clip capacity, you might want to consider using the Shotgun Spare Thermal Clip mod.
The Raider is heavier than the Wraith, weighing the same as the Venom Shotgun and Graal Spike Thrower.
Single-player
Squadmates will almost never fire the Raider at ranges short enough to be effective, and they do not take advantage of its full firing rate.
The Raider's wide spread and two-shot magazine makes it inadvisable to use to stop Dr. Eva during Priority: Mars.
Multiplayer
Armor-Piercing Rounds enable shooting through cover, Guardian shields, or enemy armor plating with no damage penalty if the piercing mods are not equipped; such mods are basically made redundant by high level Armor-Piercing Rounds anyway.
As the Marksman power allows for instant reloading on cast and drastically reduces projectile spread, the Raider can be a good option for the Quarian Marksman Soldier or the Turian Soldier; the latter can benefit from the stability bonuses available to the turian classes.
