Sorvis Lenn is a salarian botanist who is part of the diplomatic party sent to Aya at the Andromeda Initiative's embassy.
Lenn has an irritable personality and is noted by Rialla as being an excellent scientist, but difficult communicator. Despite being a guest on an alien sovereign world, Lenn feels entitled to special treatment. He was confronted by an angara who threatened him, accusing him of his friend's death, ranting about the "vesaal" and "selling slots to outsiders". Lenn was unable to understand what the angara was saying, believing he was inebriated. When the angara left Lenn tagged him with infrared dye to which he reports to Ryder that he can track him by scanning other angara with his omni-tool.
