Description[]
The dense atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon monoxide has turned Zosteros into a hothouse of enormous windstorms that blow toxic gases nonstop. Its most valuable deposits are cobalt and polonium, which netted it the #3 spot on a list of "Amazingly Poisonous Planets," on the popular vidshow "Your Awesome Galaxy."
The Reapers appear to have destroyed the camera drones here, as well as any scientific stations the asari may have maintained.
