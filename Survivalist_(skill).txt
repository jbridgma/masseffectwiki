Notes about the skill's mechanics
Strategies
Unlike any other asari squadmate before, Peebee can be turned into one of the squad's most resilient members by far. Speccing her Survivalist skill for health and barrier strength makes her second only to Drack in terms of staying power, and although her weapon and powers do not deal a lot of damage, the fact that she will almost never go down in battle if this path is chosen turns her into one of the most reliable support characters in the franchise.
