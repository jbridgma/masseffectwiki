Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Notes about skill's mechanics
Strategies
Because enemies in Andromeda move faster and tend not to cluster as tightly as they did in Mass Effect 3, the Rank 4 Radius evolution is much less prone to hitting multiple targets than it used to be.
The Rank 6 Detonator evolution makes Incinerate one of only a few powers capable of both priming and detonating power combos. Note:  Incinerate can't be used to self-detonate its own primed targets, however.
