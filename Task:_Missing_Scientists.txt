Walkthrough[]
Find The Missing Science Vessel[]

Using the galaxy map, navigate to the Eriksson system and activate the scanner. 
An anomaly will alert Pathfinder Ryder to a destroyed shuttle located in a Scourge cloud. All seven of Dr. Aridana's crew that were aboard were killed instantly when a Scourge flare wiped out all internal systems. Scan the wreckage to receive +50 . The mission is completed automatically after scanning. Despite Ryder commenting that "Dr. Aridana will want to know," going back to her will not produce any other dialogue related to this quest.

Aftermath[]
Ryder will receive an email sometime after completing this task:





Heartfelt Thanks
To: Ryder
From: Dr. Aridana

The families of my lost expedition asked me to convey their appreciation to you for finding their loved ones.  It's always difficult when we lose people.  But knowing what happened will help them begin the mourning process.

I hope your next excursion has a happier ending.


Aridana
