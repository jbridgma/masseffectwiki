Citadel: The Hate Monger is an assignment in Mass Effect which was cut during development. It would have taken place on the Citadel, and would have involved settling a conflict between a hanar and a security guard.[1]

Plotline[]
This assignment revolves around two characters, simply described as a hanar and a male security guard with both of whom you could talk. Either side would express their "frustration" or "rant", and the assignment would end when either the security guard could be persuaded, or when you'd convince the hanar to stop the "hate."

Trivia[]
This assignment bears a more than passing resemblance to Citadel: Presidium Prophet.
