Normandy SR-2: Crew Reactions[]
The reactions among the crew are telling as they reveal how close or not the crew is to each other, especially in light of the small number of crew aboard the starship. Crewman Matthews, who works alongside Crewman Hadley, recognizes immediately the importance of the colony to his friend and expresses his support and sympathy. On the next deck, Crewman Goldstein seeks confirmation from her friend, Crewman Hawthorne, that Hadley had a brother at the colony and both express outrage at the loss of the colony. Lastly, neither of the engineers, Kenneth Donnelly or Gabriella Daniels, mention Hadley's brother or the colony's importance to Hadley, and both express their outrage over the loss of the colony.
