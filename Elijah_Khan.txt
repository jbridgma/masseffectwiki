Elijah Khan is an arms dealer and owner of the Silver Coast Casino on the Citadel.







“There won't be an Earth left to save...” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 3 follow.




Liara T'Soni traces the purchase of an M-11 Suppressor used by CAT6 mercenaries to Khan, and discovers a correspondence between Khan and his client following CAT6's attempt on Commander Shepard's life. From the audio log, the arms dealer was displeased that CAT6 publicly used his weapons and returned their downpayment, and warned that he had information about his client if they decide to come after him. Shepard travels to Khan's casino to persuade him to hand over the information he has on the gun's purchaser.
Unfortunately, upon infiltrating Khan's office, Shepard and the squad find Khan's corpse. It is later revealed that Maya Brooks, an ex-Cerberus agent, executed Khan to tie up loose ends.
