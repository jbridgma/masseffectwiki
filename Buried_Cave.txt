“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.





The Buried Cave is a region on Havarl where its lost third monolith is located. It is at the northern end of Chasm of the Builders, initially sealed by Remnant pillars until the Roekaar soldier Taavos draws upon the knowledge of his forebear Zorai to remove the obstacles via a control pedestal at the entrance. Remnant activity in the area is cited as the reason why scans never discovered the monolith.
The cave has a bunch of resources and lootable containers. Strewn about the floor are numerous deactivated Remnant units, caused by Zorai when she journeyed inside the cave in an attempt to switch on the third monolith. However, she died before she could do so, and eventually her remains would be found by Pathfinder Ryder and Taavos.
The monolith is at the deepest recesses of the cave. Unlike the others, this one is far underground and requires a gravity well for access to the bottom. Despite this, Ryder encounters no activation problems as the beam still converges at the Ancient Courtyard to reveal access to the world's vault.
