Cerberus Weapon and Armor is a DLC pack for Mass Effect 2 that includes a new weapon and armor set. The pack was released on February 9, 2010.

Description[]
Designed with three things in mind: shields, thick armor, and auxiliary ammo packs, the Cerberus Assault Armor is given to shock troopers who are expected to turn the tide of battle against forces that would decimate normal soldiers. Additionally, the M-22 Eviscerator Shotgun comes standard issue. Lethal at close range, the Eviscerator Shotgun is a favorite among Cerberus operatives who like to get up close and personal with their foes.
