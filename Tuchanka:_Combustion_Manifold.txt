Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Mordin: Old Blood

This assignment is available after first visiting Tuchanka. The mechanic can be found near the back of Urdnot Camp working on the broken tomkah; talking to him will start the assignment. Because the assignment occurs during Mordin's loyalty mission, you will need to talk to the Chief Scout to begin that mission.
The assignment can be obtained even without talking to the mechanic, resulting in a slightly different journal entry upon gaining the item.

Walkthrough[]

The combustion manifold can only be found while completing Mordin's loyalty mission. Before entering the hospital, take the combustion manifold from the overturned truck. After finishing the loyalty mission, return to the mechanic and hand over the manifold.
