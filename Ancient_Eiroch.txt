The Ancient Eiroch is a rare eiroch variant that can be found on Eos, Voeld, Kadara and Elaaden, usually during specific missions only or in very secluded areas.  

Scanner Information[]
Ancient Eiroch


DATA:
Classification: Mammal
Origin: Andromeda
ANALYSIS:
Larger and more dangerous than its mundane version, the ancient eiroch is a fearsome and frenzied carnivorous predator.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
They behave similarly to normal Eirochs, except with amplified strength and smaller weak-point areas. 

Defensive
Ancient eirochs have much more armor than lesser eirochs.

Tactics[]
Ancient eirochs are essentially tougher versions of regular eirochs with the same behavioral patterns and weaknesses. Tactics for beating regular eirochs are still useful against ancient eirochs, only they take longer to kill.
Incinerate, Invasion, and Flamethrower are just as effective against an ancient eiroch.
