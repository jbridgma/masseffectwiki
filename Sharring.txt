Description[]
Sharring is a standard hydrogen-helium gas giant. The atmosphere contains traces of ammonia, methane, and surprisingly large amounts of water vapor, making the atmosphere a striking mix of browns, blues, and whites. Of Sharring's 60-odd moons, two have diameters of over 3,000 kilometers. Both have signs of former Prothean development, suggesting Sharring may have been mined for helium-3.

Survey Text[]

“The planet Sharring displayed some strange readings while being scanned. Chief Engineer Adams pinpointed the source and located a strange object. Tali and Adams brought it on board and spent hours taking it apart. The purpose of the object is still uncertain, but it was Prothean in nature and contained a Prothean data disc.”
