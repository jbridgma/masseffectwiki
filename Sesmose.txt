Description[]
Sesmose is an ice dwarf world, its surface composed almost entirely of frozen water. Normally a planetoid this small would not rate inclusion on the system’s charts, but Sesmose's unusually large and beautiful ring of ice crystals has made it a popular subject for visual artists.
The ring is the result of a glancing equatorial impact, which left a large "trench," and threw a great deal of melted water into the atmosphere. The rings are a temporary feature that will completely decay in a few thousand years.
