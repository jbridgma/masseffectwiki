Vederia Damali
Trivia[]
This shotgun is Cora's prefered weapon as she can be seen using it for most of the time.
Sarissa and Vederia can be seen wielding this shotgun in some cutscenes during Cora's loyalty mission Cora Harper: At Duty's Edge.
Depending on squad composition, Peebee can be seen pointing this gun at the Cardinal's head in the cutscene after the boss battle near the end of the mission to neutralize the kett command center on Voeld. This marks one of the very few instances where a squadmate wields a weapon other than their own, an M8 Avenger, or an X5 Ghost assault rifle.
