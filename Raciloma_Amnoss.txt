Mass Effect (cut)


Raciloma Amnoss is a character who was cut during the development of Mass Effect. He was the brother and bodyguard to the salarian drug cartel leader Sannul "Smiley" Amnoss.
After their clan disappeared in an earthquake, the Amnoss brothers, Sannul and Raciloma, turned to crime to fend off starvation. With Sannul taking the nickname "Smiley" and eventually becoming the head of a drug cartel, Raciloma became his second in command and bodyguard.[1] He is said to be an exceptional assassin, being responsible for the death of "the Zedor minister, Kurinar 7."[2] On Caleston, he shares a rivalry with Sessa Tarrent, the Union's own assassin. The two seem to have some romantic history between them, having worked together for four years.[3]
When Shepard first comes to the Throw Down refinery, Raciloma can be seen violently beating down Union men who were harassing scientist Violetta Rossi on her way to the labs, who seems to have a friendly and respectful relationship with him. Sessa Tarrent is eventually contracted by Tombiri to kill Raciloma, and she reluctantly sets up an ambush with Shepard's help. Raciloma, upon meeting her, quickly realizes what's happening but orders his men not to shoot Sessa, as she does the same for him. However, Raciloma somehow ends up mortally wounded, and dies by Sessa's side. He tells her he doesn't blame her for taking his contract as he would have done the same, and tells her to always stay professional and hide who she is really is.
