See also: Weekend Events, Challenges, N7 Operations
In Mass Effect 3's multiplayer mode, Weekend Challenges were presented each weekend for players to complete and earn exclusive rewards. Weekend Challenges were announced on October 8, 2012 as a replacement for Weekend Events following the release of Mass Effect 3: Retaliation, and were implemented on October 19, 2012. Weekend Challenges did not include an overall community goal that rewards a Victory Pack, only a squad or individual goal that rewards a Commendation Pack. Unlike Weekend Events, rewards were issued immediately upon completing the challenge, instead of at the end of the event.[1][2]

Participation[]
Weekend Challenges required Mass Effect 3: Retaliation to be downloaded, and were available on all platforms. Weekend Challenges did not require the "Upload Gameplay Feedback" option in the online options menu to be active.[3]
