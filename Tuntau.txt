Description[]
Tuntau is an enormous, low-density terrestrial planet, with a thick atmosphere of methane and helium. Despite being nearly 20 AU from Phoenix, the star's great heat and the insulating thickness of the atmosphere make the surface surprisingly temperate.
The crust is mainly composed of sodium and silicon dioxide with deposits of various light metals. While Tuntau is not habitable, the relative pleasantness of the surface conditions make it a popular location for small ships traveling through the Argos Rho cluster to land for drive discharge.

Properties[]
Tuntau has a lot of flat traversable terrain but most of its notable locations are situated in rugged areas. The lithium deposit in particular lies at the westernmost boundary of the map, and getting there may prompt Joker to warn against leaving the mission area.
