Turrets are powerful synthetic units. They are deployed by batarian terrorists to support their assault on the Citadel. They are immobile, but compensate for that with firepower.

Tactics[]
These have a strong health and shields bar while they can also inflict huge damage in a short time. You should avoid their fire as much as possible.
As they are immobile, it is easy to take cover against them. Use that to your advantage.
Like others enemies in Mass Effect Galaxy, their shields will begin to regenerate 1.5 seconds after being disabled, but their health will not.
