Description[]
A pressure-cooker of a planet, Venture has a thick nitrogen-based atmosphere that is also the source of wealth for a small colonist industry. While Venture's high temperatures are brutal, the primordial soup is not as acidic as on other hothouse planets, and xenon can be readily collected and isolated from the lower troposphere by recovery bots. This xenon is then sold for use in ion drives and electric lights. Venture's gravity is relatively low for a planet of its size, making the recovery more economical than would otherwise be expected.
