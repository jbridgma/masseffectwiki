Listen up!
I'm sending this out because too many of our new recruits don't get that being part of C-Sec on the Citadel isn't like security on a garden planet. I want you to drill the following into their heads until they're sick of your voice:
1. Learn Your District
Contacts don't make themselves. There's a mandatory minimum of twenty hours on foot patrol during your work week. No exceptions.
2. Update Your Translators
The Citadel gets more than nine million tourists a week. You need to understand whether that drunk from Omega's enjoying the nightlife or telling his buddies to flank you.
3. Eyes Are On Us
Everyone from the Council to your bus driver is watching the new C-Sec. Yak all you want in the locker room, but remember a mistake in uniform can get plastered over the whole damn galaxy's news network.
That's it for now. Come to me with any problem cases you think we need to lean on or boot out.
Bailey
