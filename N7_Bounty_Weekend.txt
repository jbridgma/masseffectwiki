In Mass Effect 3's multiplayer mode, BioWare holds special Weekend Events which offer exclusive rewards. These events typically take place during the weekends (currently occurring every other weekend) from 5:00 pm PST on Friday, to 5:00 am PST the following Monday. The reward for participating in an event varies from additional character experience for the event's duration or item packs. For completing the objectives for certain events, individual players can receive a Commendation Pack, and the community can receive a Victory Pack. However, if the community fails to complete a weekend event, they will suffer negative effects during the next event.
Beginning October 19, 2012, Weekend Events were replaced by Weekend Challenges, which only offer a squad or individual goal without an overall community goal. Weekend Events with community goals will still be held, but less frequently than the Challenges.[1]

Participation[]
Initially, the weekend challenge events were only available on the PC and the Xbox 360 as Sony did not allow such events on the PlayStation 3. Beginning with Operation Exorcist on April 27, 2012, BioWare announced that weekend challenge events would be made available across all three platforms from then on.[2]
In order to participate in weekend challenges, ensure that the "Upload Gameplay Feedback" is set to "on" in the online options menu.[3]
