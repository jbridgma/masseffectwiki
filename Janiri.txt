Description[]
Janiri is a hydrogen-helium gas giant, named for an ancient asari goddess of seasons, storms and agriculture. With the advent of the siari religion, Janiri's holy day Janiris became largely secular, but it is still celebrated on worlds with asari influence.
During the Reaper attack on Thessia, the asari armada used Janiri as a staging base for their hit-and-run attacks on the invading Reapers, striking, jumping to FTL to lose pursuers, and discharging the static into Janiri's magnetic field as they prepared for another attack. This forced the Reapers to mount a counter-offensive to drive the asari away from the planet, using ships that would otherwise have been hammering Thessia itself.
