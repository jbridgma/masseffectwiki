Player Notes[]
When used, the power sends out a series of explosive biotic impacts in front of the player ignoring any obstacles. This can be exploited to attack while remaining safe from enemy fire and also to hit enemies hiding behind cover, though it may take multiple castings, especially as the path of the shockwave can be altered in unpredictable ways by firing it through terrain.
It can be unleashed along the ground to launch all enemies in its path into the air, or used against already airborne targets which can send them flying great distances, sometimes off the map for an environmental kill.
As with all force-imparting attacks, Shockwave will instantly kill any unarmored Husks or Abominations it hits.
Shockwave can be used against most destructible environmental objects; care should obviously be taken when using the power in close proximity to anything explosive.
When Shockwave hits a protected (possessing armor, shields, or barrier) target it won't be sent flying but it will be stunned briefly, losing a bit of protection in the process. The damage done depends on the level of the power's impact force. This can be useful for stopping advancing enemies and suppressing their fire.
Having a target "locked" before performing a Shockwave starts the impacts ahead of the player closer to the target. Without any enemy locked, Shockwave will always start at the player's feet.
If the player uses Shockwave, and brings up either the Power Wheel or the Weapons Wheel (tactical pause), the Shockwave's visual effect won't stop, but its gameplay effects are only noticed after closing the Wheel.
This ability is similar to the Scion's attack, but has different effects and properties.
Shockwave has no effect at all against totally frozen enemies.

Lifting Shockwave
Suspend targets in the air for a short time.




Player Notes[]
Shockwave can hit up to 2 targets per cast, including Swarmers.
Unlike in Mass Effect 2, Shockwave no longer travels along the ground, but now travels straight outwards from a character in the direction faced. It can thus be used on targets above or below the caster. The range and area of effect of the power is smaller than in the previous game, but it is more consistent and predictable overall. Also different from the previous game, Shockwave is guaranteed to deal some level of damage to any target hit, on top of any damage caused by the force component of the ability. The multiplayer version of Shockwave deals significantly more damage.
As in Mass Effect 2, Shockwave can travel through cover. This aspect can be exploited to remain safe from enemy fire and attack with impunity. Shockwave has a much shorter base range than in Mass Effect 2, so for maximum cover penetration, take the Reach evolution at Rank 5.
Shockwave force will stagger most protected infantry enemies while knocking most unprotected (red bar) infantry enemies off their feet entirely. Enemies that are carried forward by the force of the shockwaves can be damaged by multiple pulses of the ability.
Shockwave is a detonator power for all types of Power Combos, and with the Lifting Shockwave evolution can even prime unprotected infantry enemies for Biotic Explosions. Biotic combo damage can be further enhanced with the Rank 5 Detonate evolution. Shockwave is also one of the few powers that can detonate multiple primed enemies with one use, as each individual cast can detonate two combos. This, coupled with its moderately low recharge speed, makes it useful in a power-heavy party.
The Lifting Shockwave evolution only primes lifted enemies for a relatively short time as the duration of the lift is fairly short baseline, making it somewhat challenging for the player to detonate it with their own follow-up powers unless power cooldown times are close to the minimum possible, or abilities with no cooldown are used, e.g. Nova or Cluster Grenade. The lift duration can be increased through the duration-increasing evolutions of powers such as the Adept's Biotic Mastery, making the self-performance of combos more feasible.
Using a Shockwave on Cerberus Guardians or CAT6 Heavies will cause them to stagger, leaving them less protected against weapon fire for a brief moment. Lifting Shockwave will not dislodge or remove their handheld shields.
In multiplayer, using Shockwave while standing next to a player armed with a sniper rifle, or against targets near a player using a sniper rifle, can severely disrupt the other player's aim.
Shockwave can be used to set off Geth Trip Mines at a safe distance.

Multiplayer: Human Adept, Human Vanguard, Batarian Enforcer Sentinel, Krogan Shaman Adept
Bugs[]
On the PC version of Mass Effect 3, Shockwave's Rank 4 Radius evolution is bugged: after several impacts it will stop affecting enemies, though the effects will sometimes resume after several more uses. This bug exists in both single-player and multiplayer. To avoid this bug do not choose Rank 4 Radius, though reloading a save in single-player can temporarily eliminate the bug.
Trivia[]
When attacked by Shockwave, some enemies in Mass Effect 2 will exclaim warnings to their allies that are usually only reserved for when Shepard uses heavy weapons, e.g. "They've got heavies!"
