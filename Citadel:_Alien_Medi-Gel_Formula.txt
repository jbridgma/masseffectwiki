A new medi-gel formula has been recovered from Sanctum. Find someone on the Citadel who can use it.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: N7: Cerberus Lab

Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven

While assaulting the Cerberus base on Sanctum you can obtain both the mission and mission objective at once. 
Alternatively, after the turian primarch's rescue from Menae Huerta Memorial Hospital becomes accessible. Listen to Dr. Ravin there. The doctor is standing on the left as you exit the elevator.

Walkthrough[]
Note: This mission must be completed before doing Priority: Tuchanka as it will be the last opportunity to visit the Citadel in its present state. It is no longer available the next time the civilian areas reopen, after Priority: The Citadel II. 


In the room labeled LT5 past a set of stairs, access a console to reveal a "failed" Cerberus experiment. While it produces a breakthrough for hanar, it won't do anything for humans. After finishing N7: Cerberus Lab, go to Huerta Memorial and hand the formula over to Dr. Ravin. Note:  Whichever way you acquired this mission you cannot complete it until after Priority: Palaven.
If you miss the hanar medi-gel formula during the mission, it will be available for purchase at the Spectre Requisitions terminal in the Citadel Embassies for a base price of 1,000 credits.
Completing this mission gives you 30 experience, 1,000 credits, and updates the Hanar and Drell Forces War Asset.
