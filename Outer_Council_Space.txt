Outer Council Space is a region of the Milky Way galaxy. It consists of the majority of space claimed by the asari as well as the elcor homeworld. It is bordered by Inner Council Space and the Attican Traverse.
While the elcor content themselves with their home system and a handful of colonies, the asari have settlements across the territory. Easily the most economically powerful sector of the galaxy, the asari worlds use their financial clout to keep the galactic market stable. Their military fleets patrol shipping lanes and colony space against smugglers arriving via relays from the Attican Traverse.

Trivia[]
There is a contradiction regarding the location of the Citadel. The Galaxy at War map states that it is located in Inner Council Space while the galaxy map used to navigate the Normandy indicates that it is in Outer Council Space (albeit close to the border with Inner Council Space).  This would also apply to the colony Bekenstein as it is located in the same cluster as the Citadel.
