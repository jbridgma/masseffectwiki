Description[]

DATA:

Nucleus: 7.6 km
Coma Cloud: 56,000 km
Current Tail: 740,000 km
ANALYSIS:
This comet is rich in the empirically useful nephrite, although other elements have complicated exploration. Very bright, but a second orbit is unlikely. Best to mine it for other purposes.
Awards a random small amount of Platinum when scanned.

Trivia[]
The object is likely a reference to Dawn Star, a prominent character from Jade Empire, another BioWare RPG. The mineral nephrite is also a type of jade.
