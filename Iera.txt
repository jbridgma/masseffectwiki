Iera is a gateway system. However, unlike most other gateway systems, it has no fuel depot. 
Because of Horizon, the system is a popular destination for people stifled by Citadel restrictions. Its worlds have uneven resource distribution: Venture is harsh, but cost-effective to mine, Prospect had a resource rush on its moons but the galactic supply and demand drove much of its operations to economic ruin, and Watchman has barely anything of note.
