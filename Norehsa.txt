Description[]
Norehsa is an unremarkable methane-ammonia ice giant with a small family of icy moons. It is likely that the Qertassi system had additional worlds earlier in its history, but these have been swallowed by the aging giant star.
Qertassi is an elderly, metal-poor Population II star, broadly similar to Arcturus.
