Forward Station Protocol Initiated

Preset Viability Metrics: MISMATCH

Habitat 1, named Eos, does not match Initiative preflight profiles. Advance predictives are no longer applicable. Parameters require 94% rework.

—KNOWN—
Habitat 1: Eos
Discovered: Attr. Founder Jien Garson
Orbital data onboard
Spectrographic profiles: WORKING...
Geo-sounding: WORKING...
Radiation Sv: LETHAL at deployment
ALERT: Fallout from Scourge is exceptionally volatile on contact, with equally aggressive decline.

Live Records Coordination

Conflict: ongoing geological mismatch
Expanding data collation to live reports

Reporting: Spec. Karin Miura
Live-link begins:
-…and it's just a mess. Wait, going live. Let's have a look at Eos, hmm? The Pathfinder is really pushing exploration. The first two sites didn't get this… what in the world?

-No, it's just still amazing to me. Eos is so different than we expected. Thought we were smart with that geth "relay-scope" method, but 600 years changed it all.

-Well, of course that's short for a planet. But look at it. Oh, wait… it's recording. Ugh, block audio, it just needs manual input—

MagRes Geo-sounding Report

Conflict: ongoing geological mismatch
Mapping tectonic parameters

—KNOWN—
Reporting: Spec. Karin Miura
Live-link begins:
-…still we venture, as the brave. Watch the rocks, they're falling daily, careless miners always fail, keep your hands upon your credits and your eyes upon the scale.

-Well of course you don't like it, your dad didn't sing it until all you dreamt of was rocks. I swear, if you want ground-zero for accidental masters degrees, go to lullabies. Still, as a mnemonic device, it got me through Applied GeoTech. Always watch the… did you hit record? You son of a f—

Multiple-Deployment Coordination
—Forward Station Network established—
Initiating magnetospheric tomography

—KNOWN—
Climate: Seasonal Arid
Planetwide climate uniformity is unlikely to have occurred naturally.
Tropospheric electron density has suffered manipulation.
Geological limiters suspected.
Scourge radiation and impact suspected.
Artificial atmospheric alteration suspected.
Whether climate uniformity was intentional or a product of Scourge impact: unknown.

Octologic Override

ERROR: 8 Station Link failed
Source: Deep-core mass alteration
Expanding data collation to live reports

—KNOWN—
Reporting: Spec. Karin Miura
Live-link begins:
-How did you get to Base-8 with six fingers?

-Well, how would I know that's not how it works? I'm an exogeologist, not a mathematician.

-A skew-octagon? Look, just work your twitchy salarian magic so I can "octologically" compensate for the relativistic drift.

-The Pathfinder's stations don't need to know why it's happening, they just need to compensate for it.

-Is that on again? Christ, HR will be all over my—

Live-link begins:
-Hello out there. It's you, right? Who else?

-Station number nine! No, you don't get a turn, I'm recording this for the Pathfinder. Don't tell me I had too much, it was your bottle. Look, it's late, we're all tired. But we're having a good time. It'll be fine. Shhh. Shhhh, it's a secret. But Pathfinder. Team. We think you're Sexy. As. Fuck. Everyone in exogee… exogo… Everyone up here agrees! Your data is soooo good! Anyway, we were having a party because you're not dead. So many people were dead. But not you. That's fuuh… that's ffu… um. We're having a good time.

-Yeah, I should sign off.

-Is that… can I send the… I'm just hitting send.

Live-link begins:
-Hoooo-leee shit. Do you see that? The tomography of the core… and the extant saturation of the radiological fallout… is that a manufactured ripple in the magnetosphere?

-Oh, I don't know either. But with all this new data, we're about to have a whole new branch of science, not just some new goddamn words. Take that, Professor Karr, and your "I discovered a new brown rock" or whatever. We're in Andromeda and the Pathfinder just hiked up a planet's kilt!

-It is too a phrase.

-Well, what's the salarian equivalent?

-That is physically improbable.

-What do you mean "not since that party"?

-You give me that recording! So help me, I will gut the Live-link feature for all further—

MUSIC: Inspirational
We predict Habitat 1 is a lush and vibrant world. The Green Band rush is over. The Citadel is a world away. And there's more to freedom than the Terminus. This golden world offers a true pioneer thousands of kilometers of untamed potential. And with advanced genetic storage, in mere months we'll be deploying the literal creature comforts that will enable you to thrive.
