Note: This article features material from the first edition of Mass Effect: Deception, which BioWare has acknowledged contains discrepancies with other Mass Effect lore. Once revised editions of the book are released, this article will be updated.
Jana is the Illusive Man's assistant in 2186. Her duties include assigning Cerberus operatives to tasks that are beneath the Illusive Man's attention, filtering calls and messages, and acting as a guide on the rare occasion people are allowed to meet the Illusive Man. She is described as having black hair, large brown eyes, and a full figure. Before joining Cerberus, Jana was a military officer of unspecified affiliation.
Kai Leng wondered how human Jana really was, and believed the Illusive Man was trying to groom her for a greater role.

Trivia[]
The Illusive Man can be seen in video logs on Cronos Station discussing indoctrination with a scientist named Jana. This scientist had blonde hair.
