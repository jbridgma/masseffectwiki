The taurg is a pinkish four-eyed beast that can be found on Eos and Elaaden. It is similar in build to the galorn, although the taurg looks more ungulate than the latter.
Like many large creatures, the taurg disintegrates upon death, although it may leave behind Renderable Plates.

Scanner Information[]
Taurg


DATA:
Classification: Mammal
Origin: Andromeda
ANALYSIS:
A mammoth, hoofed beast that barks its warning, and, when attacked, rushes forward to stomp and headbutt. 

Capabilities[]
Offensive
The taurg only has a melee charge and headbutt that deals minimal damage.

Defensive
It is protected by armor.

Tactics[]
Taurgs are difficult to antagonize, seldom bothering to hit back even when they're attacked. They are also slow movers, and can be outrun with minimal effort on the rare occasion they turn hostile.
As armor-only units, they're vulnerable to the expected counters like Incinerate or Flamethrower.
