The Vorcha Heavy is a rocket launcher-wielding soldier identical to the Blood Pack Boom-Squad. In contrast, however, Heavies are not beholden to the Blood Pack and do not sport their gang insignia, and they take to the field in black garb instead of the red in Blood Pack members. They are independent elements who seek to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the Collector plague infecting all races except vorcha and humans.
In 2185, a few Heavies support Blood Pack troops in securing Omega's Gozu District and ensuring no cure disperses to the populace. However, they are defeated by Commander Shepard, who spreads a cure for the plague made by Mordin Solus via the district's ventilation systems.

Capabilities[]
Offensive
The standard armament of a Vorcha Heavy is the ML-77 Missile Launcher which they fire once, or twice in rapid succession, before ducking back behind cover.

Defensive
Like most vorcha, they wear light armor and depend on their natural regenerative abilities during a fight. They also tend to find cover quickly. They'll pop up for a few seconds at a time to shoot missiles. They only have health in normal difficulty, though they gain an armor bar in higher difficulties.

Tactics[]
Vorcha Heavies are essentially Boom-Squads in all but name, and have inherited the enemy type's strengths and weaknesses. Tactics for beating Boom-Squads also apply to Heavies.
