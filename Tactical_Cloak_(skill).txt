Player Notes[]
Mechanics
As with Tactical Cloak variants in the original trilogy, activation causes enemies to lose their focus and/or target locks on the user.
The two branches of Tactical Cloak revolve around extra damage or extra mobility.
Fully investing in duration brings to a total of 11 seconds cloaking while fully investing in recharge speed brings down recharge time to 8 seconds.
Strategies
One of the most versatile skills in the game, Tactical Cloak can be employed in so many situations it is one of the skills that should be given priority when allocating points. Among others, one can perform stealth revives of fallen teammates, escape from combat hot zones, ambush combat hot zones or specific targets, hold down location objectives while minimizing enemy presence in the area, take objectives to drop zones without anyone noticing, disable devices without alerting nearby foes, etc.
It's still prudent to move elsewhere when cloak is activated. Nearby enemies will lose their focus but they will assume their prey is still in its last known location and keep firing in that general direction.
