Inamorda is a krogan bounty hunter who can be found on the Port Hanshan Mezzanine on Noveria, on the second floor of the hotel. A quick-tempered krogan, he's keen to brush off attempts at conversation with him. 







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Inamorda is the intended recipient of an experimental weapon mod Opold has smuggled onto the planet. At the mention of Opold's name, Inamorda becomes more receptive to Shepard's words, offering to buy the package directly from the Commander instead of having to deal with the hanar later. Shepard can haggle with the bounty hunter, who agrees if properly persuaded.
If the Commander decides to keep the item and tells Opold this, a gang of krogan led by Inamorda will attack Shepard's group upon their next return to the Normandy. If Shepard informs Inamorda that the item has been turned over to Administrator Anoleis, the krogan will not attack, but will allude to an unpleasant chat with Opold.

Tactics[]
Tactics useful for beating generic krogan enemies apply to Inamorda as well.
Inamorda liberally makes use of his Immunity and Shield Boost powers at Insanity.
Unusual for krogan enemies in Mass Effect, Inamorda's thugs utilize sniper rifles, making them potentially deadly at long range as well as close range.
The area where you fight Inamorda's group makes using biotics to levitate them and then fling them off the docking bay gangways to their deaths a very viable strategy.
