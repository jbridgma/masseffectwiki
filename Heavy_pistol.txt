Mass Effect 2[]
Heavy pistols are a class of semi-automatic weapons with a relatively low rate of fire and limited ammunition but relatively high damage per shot. They are an invaluable backup weapon, effective against armor and fairly accurate at even long ranges. Like all other non-heavy weapon types in Mass Effect 2 with the exception of sniper rifles, heavy pistols benefit from increasing damage against targets at close ranges, maximized at point-blank (melee) range.
All player classes start the game able to use heavy pistols. The following squadmates in Mass Effect 2 utilize heavy pistols: Jack, Jacob, Miranda, Mordin, Tali, Kasumi, Liara and Wilson.

Mass Effect 3[]
Heavy pistols are incredibly versatile weapons. Depending on the model and any modifications used, they can vary widely in weight and stopping power. Heavy pistols can be customized to fill almost any role, from niche backup weapon, all the way to devastatingly powerful primary weapon.
Most heavy pistols are semi-automatic and fairly accurate by default, and their accuracy can usually be increased by aiming down sights, taking cover, or equipping a basic scope.
Heavy pistols can also be modded to enhance power damage, melee damage, or to drastically reduce their weight, all of which can make them attractive for any user not primarily reliant on weapon damage. Having a heavy pistol as the active weapon allows for faster melee attacks than with shotguns, sniper rifles, or assault rifles.
The following squadmates utilize heavy pistols: Admiral Anderson, EDI, Javik, Kaidan, Liara, Tali, Wrex, Nyreen, Jack, Jacob, Kasumi, and Miranda.
