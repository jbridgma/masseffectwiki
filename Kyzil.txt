Kyzil is the vorcha home system, with worlds as hostile as the belligerent species. What modest resources are there are exploited by non-vorcha entities like asari or alien corporations.
The Reapers largely annihilated any pitiful resistance mustered by the locals with little to no loss in their numbers. However, they are stalled harvesting on Heshtok itself, as the vorcha simply evolve countermeasures against anything the Reapers do, short of full-scale extermination.
