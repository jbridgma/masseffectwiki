Olvek is an angaran that works in the infirmary of the Angaran Resistance on Aya. He is very courteous to Pathfinder Ryder and apologizes for his lack of knowledge in human physiology. Olvek can provide medical treatment information for angara for Lexi to study so that she can better treat Jaal. In addition he can answer questions regarding the ion beds at the facility. When the topic turns toward the angara's bioelectricity he humbly says it's nothing special and was surprised that humans do not possess such abilities. He does however have an interest in understanding more about biotics.
