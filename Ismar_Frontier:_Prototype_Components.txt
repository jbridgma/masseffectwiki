A scientist is searching for missing prototypes for a biotic amplification system. Search the Ismar Frontier for the components and return them to the scientist on the Citadel.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven

At Huerta Memorial Hospital, enter the room across the corridor from your injured squadmate's in order to overhear a salarian scientist having a comm conversation about the missing prototypes.

Walkthrough[]
Note: This mission must be completed before doing Priority: Tuchanka as it will be the last opportunity to visit the Citadel in its present state. It is no longer available the next time the civilian areas reopen, after Priority: The Citadel II. 


The biotic prototypes can be found by scanning Metaponto in the Aquila system of the Ismar Frontier cluster. Upon acquisition, you're granted an Advanced Biotic Implants upgrade that you can redeem at the Intel Terminal in Liara's quarters on Deck 3 of the Normandy SR-2.
After returning the biotic prototypes to the salarian on the Citadel, you will receive 90 experience; no credits are given. The salarian is glad he'll be able to help and claims it'll save a lot of Alliance lives, although nothing further comes of it gameplay-wise or storywise.
The salarian scientist does not have an icon marked on the map, and there is no manual trigger for the conversation to complete the mission. Instead, simply enter the lab where the scientist is, and completion will automatically play out.
