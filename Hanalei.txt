Description[]
Early surveyors of Hanalei dismissed its resource potential, saying it had "more heat than a planet needs and more argon than a galaxy would buy." As an enormous terrestrial planet buried under a merciless atmosphere of argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, Hanalei hosted only small orbital stations that were primarily scientific in nature. The facilities have since been destroyed by the Reapers.
