Player Notes[]
The Rank 6 Squad Bonus evolution applies to all members of the party including James (however, it is bugged, see below). There is possibility for confusion, as similarly named "Squad Bonus" evolutions on Shepard's various class powers do not apply to Shepard, only to NPC squadmates.
Bugs[]
Unlike other powers which decrease the shield-recharge delay, the Arms Master Rank 5 Shield Recharge Evolution description is worded with a double negative, stating it decreases the delay by -20%, which would actually be an increase in the delay before shields began recharging. This is a description error only, the evolution actually does speed up shield recharge as all other analogous power evolutions do.
The Rank 6 Squad Bonus evolution is bugged; it is supposed to increase the shields and health of the entire squad, but this effect often does not apply properly and only James benefits, not the other squad members. There may be potential workarounds to this bug, see the Talk page.
