Olisk handles the logistics of the Angaran Resistance Base on Voeld.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Multiple pieces of encrypted correspondence indicate that supplies intended for the Resistance are being lost, and Olisk is actively suppressing the news out of fear that it will lead to a slump in morale. He hasn't actually received a shipment in weeks, and he has been forced to claim to his peers that their supplies have been redirected at the last moment. He's not willing to send someone from the base to investigate as word will get around. Simply telling the truth is out of the question, since Olisk feels he knows what's best for the camp.
If Pathfinder Ryder reads one such correspondence directed at Olisk, he's surprised the Pathfinder can even read his datapads. Later though he supposes they can find out who has been taking the supplies. Turns out it's not the kett as Olisk guessed, but the Roekaar have been stealing from their own people. Should Ryder deal with the Roekaar at the latest drop point, Olisk receives word of it and extends his gratitude.
Olisk can sometimes be overheard reporting to Anjik Do Xeel about various matters. He passes along word from the scouts that the kett are planning to attack Techiix, and asks Anjik if they can spare to send troops there in light of their manpower issues. If the exaltation facility was destroyed after Moshae Sjefa's rescue, he doesn't think it likely there are any survivors. He has also received a report from Hjara Station regarding the loss of their only vehicle, and hesitantly tells the commander that Yaret "handled" the problem.
