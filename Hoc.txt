Hoc is a border system between the Attican Traverse and the Terminus Systems. While it is host to prime colonization and mining prospects like Virmire and Nemata, its proximity to the politically unstable Terminus Systems preclude long-term investment and development. It is known to have been visited by lawless elements as evidenced by giant batarian graffiti on Prescyla.
