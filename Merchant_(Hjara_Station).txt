Mass Effect: Andromeda


The merchant of Hjara Station is an affable businesswoman who sells armor and consumables. She can be found at a kiosk next to the daar's lead scientist Knoeth.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The merchant is initially only aware of Pathfinder Ryder by reputation from her Aya contacts, though she likes what she has heard thus far. She regularly travels between Hjara Station and Techiix to peddle her wares, though she occasionally treks up the mountain where the Angaran Resistance Base is located. Luck has been by her side, as the kett have never caught her yet despite some close calls.
