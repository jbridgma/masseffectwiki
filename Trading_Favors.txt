If you obtained this mission after meeting with the Commander and/or the lookouts, the objectives here will also be marked complete.

Search Sohkaa's navpoint on Voeld for the missing supplier[]
There is a Forward Station to the east of Hjara Station to fast travel to the region with the navpoint . Just to the southwest of the forward station is the navpoint location. Head to the navpoint and at the navpoint is an abandoned camp.

Investigate the supply camp[]
