Prerequisite: Liam Kosta: All In

Description[]
DATA:
Objects: Multiple
Species Origin: Multiple
Orbits: Irregular, unstable
ANALYSIS:
Multiple irregular trajectories suggest the field is a product of repeated jettisoning of waste, not a single explosive event. Signal clutter and planetary background radiation is preventing accurate scans. It's possible one or more ships could remain undetected in this quagmire.
