“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The Common Area section of the Nexus is the main commercial, social, and transportation hub for the station. 
Pathfinder Ryder's first look inside the Nexus begins in this area, although the whole place is dark and shuttered due to a lack of resources. Once Hyperion supplies the station with energy and Ryder's introductions with the Nexus leadership are dealt with, the Common Area comes alive with people and activity.

Layout[]
The area consists of a ground floor connected by two sets of ramps to a second floor consisting mostly of overhanging walkways that connect to rooms. An artificial skylight like with the Presidium on the Citadel illuminates the place after Hyperion's arrival. Because the Common Area is adjacent to the Docking Bay, tram services list the latter to stand in for both locations.
The first floor contains several shops, access to the docking/immigration areas, a relaxation Hydroponic Gardens, and a  bar/night club named The Vortex. The upper floor allows entry to the Tech Lab, the upper portion of the Cultural Exchange, and a residential wing.
The Common Area after the influx of power from Hyperion initially consists of part of the first floor only, with entry points to the second level and The Vortex blocked off by numerous crates. Once Prodromos has been founded, all areas become accessible.
