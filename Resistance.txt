Created to liberate their homes from the oppressive onslaught of the kett invasion, the Angaran Resistance is an insurgency movement formed by the eponymous race indigenous to the Heleus Cluster of the Andromeda Galaxy.

The primary source of opposition against the kett prior to the arrival of the Andromeda Initiative in Heleus, the Resistance is an alliance of once-disparate rebel movements struggling to free the cluster from the grip of the invaders, united beneath a single banner under the leadership of Evfra de Tershaav. Witnessing first-hand how ineffective these small, scattered bands were against the overwhelming might of the kett, Evfra began the laborious process of bringing them together into a single force, gaining material support and new recruits from the civilian population and eventually bringing the other rebel leaders in line. With the destruction of the angara's formal military forces during the early phases of the kett invasion, the Resistance serves as the first line of defense for the angaran people, and maintains close ties with their political leadership. The Resistance Headquarters is located on Aya, though they maintain bases across the Heleus Cluster in support of local cells, most notably on Voeld.
