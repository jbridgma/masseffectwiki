Pirates are adversaries encountered by Jacob Taylor alongside their elite counterparts. They are fought on Cartagena, the station they have infiltrated. They can be recognized by the green color on their legs.

Tactics[]
Pirates have moderate health and kinetic shielding making them easy to eliminate. Like any other enemy in Galaxy, their shields will begin to regenerate 1.5 seconds after being disabled, but their health will not.
Pirates will attack at medium and short ranges with their assault rifles. Their shots don’t do much damage and they lack any special attacks.
Although they’re fully affected by the Jacob’s powers the use of these should be prioritized on stronger enemies if any are present.
