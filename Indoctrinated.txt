Mass Effect[]
Indoctrinated salarians are encountered at Saren Arterius' base on Virmire, where he was running experiments on indoctrination and its effects on organic beings. Captain Kirrahe's STG regiment had been assigned by the Citadel Council to investigate Saren, which eventually led them to the Virmire base. 
Kirrahe lost half of his men while investigating this base. It turns out, however, that not all of Kirrahe's men were killed: Saren imprisoned some and ran experiments on them. They may be found in various rooms of Saren's base, as well as in detainment cells.

Tactics[]
Indoctrinated salarians are armed only with pistols. Occasionally they may have weak shields though some forego any defenses entirely.
Because indoctrination has negative effects on organics' abilities to think, the Indoctrinated don't take cover and are easy to kill. Most will just charge at the squad and fire. They have no further behavior other than basic keeping a minimum distance from their targets.
