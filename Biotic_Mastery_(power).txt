Player Notes[]
The Rank 5 Squad Bonus evolution applies only to NPC squad members and not to Shepard. There is possibility for confusion, as the similarly named "Squad Bonus" evolutions of squadmates' class powers apply to the entire party including Shepard and also the owner of the power.
The Rank 6 Combo Mastery evolution goes into effect when the player detonates a Biotic Explosion and not any other type of Power Combo. The player need not have set up or "primed" the combo, but must be the one to actually detonate it (e.g. Kaidan can use Reave on an enemy to prime it for a combo but Shepard must be the one to detonate the combo to receive the bonus to recharge speed).
