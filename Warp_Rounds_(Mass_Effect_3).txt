Ammo Bonuses[]
Ammo Bonuses apply single-mission effects to shots fired from weapons. A weapon imbued with an ammo bonus will apply additional ammo damage that is separate from impact damage. With the exception of Incendiary Ammo, which applies a damage-over-time effect that lasts 3 seconds, ammo damage is applied before the impact damage. Only a few weapon damage bonuses improve ammo damage; usually, it will be the listed percentage of the weapon's base damage. Ammo damage is very heavily affected by the target's current defense and with most ammo types, there will be 0 ammo damage to certain defenses.

Contrary to the in-game description, Incendiary Rounds apply only a damage-over-time effect, doing 10/20/30/50% damage over 3 seconds[3].
There's a buggy damage recalculation when re-applying Incendiary Rounds on a target, allowing them to reach up to triple damage with constant fire.
Incendiary Rounds do no extra damage against shields and barriers. The default damage modifiers can be overwritten through buggy interactions with Warp, Incinerate, Flamer, Inferno Grenade, Electrical Hammer, Homing Grenade and Fire Explosions. Refer to the articles for details.
Incendiary Rounds prime Fire Explosions after doing 30 points of damage [4].
Incendiary Rounds will permanently prevent the health regeneration of enemies such as Cannibals and Phantoms.

Notes:

The Biotic Damage Bonus is applied as an additional ammo-damage bonus against any target which has been primed for a Biotic Explosion. After detonating the explosion (or if the priming effect wears off on its own), this additional bonus will no longer be dealt.[5]
