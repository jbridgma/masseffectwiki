Description[]
Naskral is a small, hot, tidally locked inner planet that had modest minerals development on its dark side. Within a generation of the vorcha's first contact with spacefaring species, robo-mining interests attempted to exploit it only to find their trading partners violently overthrown on a regular basis. The vorcha's own culture disenfranchised them in Naskral's case, as their legal claims to the planet were inevitably backed up by violence as a show of dominance. This nuance was lost on the mining corporations, who hired mercenaries to guard their operations with lethal force and never surrendered it to vorcha claimants.
The Reapers sent a small force to destroy Naskral's orbital stations and surface facilities. There is no indication that there are any survivors.
