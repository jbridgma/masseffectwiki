Description[]
Oma Ker is a temperate garden world currently in its megafauna stage. The planet's nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and dextro-amino-acid-based life wasn't particularly attractive to the volus, so they sold the colonization rights to their turian partners.
Oma Ker's spaceports and major roads were blasted into craters by the Reapers, largely immobilizing the population. Its turian defenders are slowly being pushed back by ground forces.
