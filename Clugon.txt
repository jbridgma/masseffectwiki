Description[]
Clugon's hydrogen-helium atmosphere is given a fairly dramatic emerald tint by chlorine and ionized gases. It has nearly 100 moons.

Properties[]
The system is no older than 10 million years and the planet is far too small to be a gas giant (although, to their credit, the designers did not claim explicitly that this planet was a gas giant). Clugon is likely a large terrestrial planet; a Tungel with thicker cloud cover. In another system it would attract enough matter and gas to become a Neptune or even a Saturn, but this one will go supernova first.
