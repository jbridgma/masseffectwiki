This article is about the manufacturer. For the shop in Mass Effect 3, see Kassa Fabrication (shop).


A human-controlled private company, Kassa Fabrication is known to make some of the finest body armor in the galaxy (Colossus Armor). When it comes to personal protection suits, no expense is spared - as reflected in the exorbitant cost of their products. Kassa also makes top quality weapons such as the advanced Harpoon Sniper Rifle. Recently, Kassa has also begun to manufacture omni-tools, though it will be some time until the quality is brought up to the high standards of their armor lines.
In Mass Effect, licence for Kassa Fabrication equipment can be purchased from the C-Sec Requisitions Officer and Petozi on Noveria for 30,000 credits.

The Kassa Fabrications Model 12 Locust is a compact submachine gun developed for the Alliance but now favored by gang enforcers and hitmen. Featuring a complex recoil-reducing mechanism and high-grade autotargeting software, the Locust delivers longer-range, more accurate fire than others in its class.

Aegis was the name of the shield wielded by the deities Zeus and Athena in Greek mythology.
The Mass Effect Prima official guide lists two additional Kassa Fabrication weapons not found in the game: the Thorn pistol and the Apocalypse shotgun.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 49: Kassa Fabrication's ME Enhancers give +40% to Damage and Accuracy, and +8% to Heat Absorption. Compared to baseline stats, the calculations for Damage appear correct, but not the other two, despite clear increases being visible.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 49: Kassa Fabrication's Micro Generators give +50% to both DP and Shields. When compared to baseline stats, calculations for Shields appear correct but not for DP, precisely.
