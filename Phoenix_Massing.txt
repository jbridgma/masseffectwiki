The Phoenix Massing nebula is a gold and blue nebula located near the Perseus Veil. Geth activity in the nearby Veil is high, which occasionally spills over to this cluster. Aside from a small elcor presence on Salahiel and the squabbling inhabitants of Aite, the cluster is bereft of any major organizations exploiting its untapped resources.
