Matano is composed of five worlds, four of which are terrestrial and one is a gas giant. The Systems Alliance has claimed Chasca although they also charge ships trying to remove water from Supay and assume patrolling responsibilities against pirates. Illapa is slated to become a helium-3 production hub if Chasca's development continues.
