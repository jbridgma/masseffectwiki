Player Notes[]
Dark Sphere is an incredibly powerful biotic attack, able to take out large groups of enemies with its detonation and prime enemies for Biotic Explosions prior to detonation.
Dark Sphere travels in a straight line to where the crosshairs are pointed, sticking to any solid surface or cover it encounters (including Geth Juggernaut Soldier's Hex Shield).
Warning: The Rank 5A and 6B evolutions that increase "Duration" actually decrease damage due to a possible bug.[1]
When choosing the rank 6 "Dark Matter" evolution, the detonation radius in the power screen is only reduced once the power has been upgraded. Note:  While an initial radius of 5 m is reduced to 2.5 m, a radius of 7 m is reduced to 4.5 m rather than half.
Dark Sphere has a lengthy cooldown, although it's triggered only when the power is detonated as opposed to when it is cast. Thus, if the player has Seeker Swarms summoned before deploying the Dark Sphere, it is possible to detonate up to four biotic explosions in quick succession by using the Seeker Swarms on enemies primed by Dark Sphere.
Dark Sphere will dissipate on its own after a few seconds if not detonated by the player. The player can then launch another Dark Sphere immediately. Be careful about the timing here though: make sure the first Dark Sphere has dissipated, or activating the power again will detonate it and begin the long cooldown.
