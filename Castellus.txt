Castellus is a system of 4 terrestrial planets and a gas giant. Carborix and Fiax are the local mining worlds whose resources fuel the industries of the turian colony Digeris. Iritum has the attendant starship-relevant facilities and habitats.
The Reapers turned most of the orbital facilities on Castellus to slag, but on Digeris they face a stalemate against the stubborn turian fleet.
