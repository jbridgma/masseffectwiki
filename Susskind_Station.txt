Originally a small scientific research outpost with living modules for only 20 people, Susskind Station is a triumph of modern "snap-on" modular engineering for space station expansion. Now with facilities for over 2,000 visitors and docking for over 50 starships. Susskind serves as a spaceport for those wishing to study the Raheel-Leyya binary blue giant.
TRAVEL ADVISORY: Due to the quarian fleet occupying the system, all docks at Susskind Station are currently filled. Local authorities predict this condition for the foreseeable future until such time as the flotilla departs.
