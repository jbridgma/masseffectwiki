Vular is a fairly developed batarian system. Its two terrestrial worlds boast vast resources and enough population centers to extract them, and Azimir has the helium-3 fueling infrastructure for ships going in and out of the system. The gas giant prevents more planets from forming with its gravitational influence on the two asteroid belts surrounding it.
As with most batarian systems in their home cluster, Vular has been largely eradicated by Reaper forces. Subjugation of the populace at the only habitable planet Erszbat continues via insidious indoctrination of collaborators. While Azimir's orbitals are still reduced to wreckage, the batarian navy managed to destroy several Destroyers around it, allowing some civilian ships to escape.
