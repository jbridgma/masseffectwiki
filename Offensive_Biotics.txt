Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Offensive Biotics will only work if you are actively using Biotic Skills.
Strategies
The choice of which Rank 6 evolution to take can be greatly simplified by determining whether Ryder will be using the Adept or Vanguard profiles.
Adepts (normally) would follow a biotic power with another biotic power, so the Rank 6 Biotic Expert would be a better choice.
Vanguards (normally) would follow a biotic power with a melee attack or weapon blast, so the Rank 6 Biotic Warrior would be a better choice.
If Ryder uses biotic attacks and then melee attacks (regardless of profile selected), Rank 6 Biotic Warrior would be a better choice.
Availability[]
Single-player: Pathfinder Ryder - Starting Biotic Skill
Multiplayer: Asari Adept, Asari Duelist, Asari Huntress, Asari Sentinel, Human Adept, Krogan Gladiator
