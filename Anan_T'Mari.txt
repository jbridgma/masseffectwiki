Mass Effect: Andromeda


Anan T'Mari co-manages The Vortex with fellow bartender Dutch Smith. She has a friendlier disposition compared to her irritable partner.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




The bartender bemoans the shortage of ingredients for their drinks at the bar. To that end, she wants Pathfinder Ryder's help in looking for interesting ingredients in return for free tasting of the resultant beverages. If Ryder talked to Dutch prior to this, Anan declares it a win-win, since Ryder gets free beers while Dutch gains another "guinea pig" for his experiments. The Pathfinder can initially decline, though Anan is willing to revisit the topic.
Anan frequently smooths over Dutch's grouchy behavior. She assures Ryder Dutch is sweeter than he seems, and she has great faith in his chemistry/bartending skills.
