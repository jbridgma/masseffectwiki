Collect Unearthed Remnant Devices On Havarl[]
The Remnant devices were pushed out of the ground by overgrown roots. There are no navpoints for them. The devices will always be on a root cluster and easy to identify by the blue/white sparking aura they give off. Only eight of them need to be collected to finish the task.
In total there are 21 devices split in three types that can all be collected. There are seven devices of Type 1 and seven of Type 2 which grant +15  each. There are also seven Type 3 devices that award +50 . Ryder will be able to find enough devices by following the edges of the map but the additional devices can be found for a total of +560 .
Note:  Devices found after the mission is complete still award Research Data (RD).
Note:  The Science Cryo Pod Perks Improved Development and Improved Development II DO NOT increase the value of the Research Data (RD) obtained from the devices.

Rewards[]
+270 XP
+29 AVP 
+2% Havarl viability
