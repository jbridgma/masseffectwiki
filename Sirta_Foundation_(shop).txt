Sirta Foundation is a location on the Citadel. Located in Zakera Ward's Mid-Wards District, this store is located on the 26th level of a building. Health and defense upgrades are available from this store. Kian Louros is the asari customer service representative for Sirta Foundation store. She is responsible for returns, exchanges, and group rates. Though happy at having employment, Louros doesn't understand why a human company would hire asari exclusively for their stores.
A portion of the proceeds are allocated to funding research into investigating cures for genetic diseases.

Discount[]
Commander Shepard can convince the shopkeeper to offer a discount on shop items. 

Trivia[]
In the store, Michael Petrovsky is chatting with his sister-in-law Rebekah Petrovsky about her son Jake.
In the French version, if you choose the Paragon option with a female Shepard, the subtitle does not feminize the word "hero" when she claims to be the hero/savior of the Citadel.
