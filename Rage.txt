Player Notes[]
Only actual melee kills and Biotic Charge kills count towards building Rage. Kill assists do not count.
Over-cover grabs do not count towards Rage.
Environmental impact kills attributed to melee and charge don't count either.
Killing certain minor enemies such as Swarmers, Seeker Swarms, and Geth Turrets does not count towards building or maintaining Rage.
Rage does not work like Bloodlust on the vorcha classes where getting one kill or kill assist will refresh the effect—if two or three kills are required to trigger Rage, then that is how many kills are required each time. This makes the evolutions of Rage or Warlord Rage that reduce the number of kills needed to trigger the effect very useful, as even when hunting for melee kills exclusively, it can be very difficult to chain together two or three in the necessary time frame, especially in team games where teammates can steal your kills.
Rage evolved to maximize melee damage, and using a shotgun with a Shotgun Omni-Blade (or Shotgun Blade Attachment), the already good heavy melee of a krogan becomes incredible, capable of taking down even armored super elites (e.g. Atlases, Brutes, and Geth Primes, and Praetorians). However, this is a high-risk/high-reward tactic, as most such foes can instantly kill you if you get too close.
Rage evolved to maximize health, shields and damage reduction can also be highly beneficial. Since all krogan characters possess a damage reduction-providing power (Barrier,  Tech Armor or Fortification), these classes can shrug off all but the most intense fire, even on Gold or Platinum. This makes them very useful classes especially for objective recovery, as they can happily carry the object and ignore incoming fire. Performing headbutts into the air can improve the damage reduction even further.
An active Rage effect adds a graphical filter in the player's HUD to represent a krogan's altered perceptions while enraged. This visual filter can make seeing subtle details in the environment difficult, notably the shimmer of invisible enemies such as cloaked Geth Hunters and Phantoms. The effect can actually aid visibility on certain darker maps such as Firebase Reactor, while on bright maps, especially the open-air parts of the hazard version of Firebase White, your vision can be impaired to near-blindness.
Roar: When Rage triggers, the player character will roar triumphantly. While certainly in-character for a krogan, this can be problematic as during the "celebration" animation, you are vulnerable and unable to act in any way except that you can still move. The celebration animation can be circumvented by certain actions such as firing a weapon, sprinting, or performing a heavy melee, but performing a regular melee usually does NOT work. Heavy melee can interrupt the celebration animation even once it begins and is usually the best option, whereas other actions must be performed almost immediately after killing the enemy that activates Rage before the celebration animation triggers to have a chance to circumvent it.
