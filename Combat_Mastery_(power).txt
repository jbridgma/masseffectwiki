Storm Speed: +50.00%
Paragon/Renegade: +70.00%

Player Notes[]
Combat Mastery is the only one of the six player class powers in Mass Effect 2 that improves storm speed, and the only one that does not improve power recharge time.
During combat situations with enemies active in the area, the improvement to storm speed manifests as a time dilation effect similar to that of Adrenaline Rush. The two time-dilation effects do not stack, meaning that the movement speed bonus is not providing any additional benefit to Shepard when storming during Adrenaline Rush.
