Anti-Thorian Gas I[]
These upgrades are specially designed to disable subjects infected by the Thorian without killing them. They also instantly kill Thorian Creepers, which is very helpful as they have a large amount of health on the Insanity difficulty. They do not, however, work on Asari Clones.
This upgrade is only gained during the mission on Feros from Juliana Baynham. It's recommended to use the grenades sparingly and run past infected subjects (or hit them with a melee attack) if they don't pose a serious threat.

Cryo Explosive[]

Cryo-upgraded grenades contain a small Bose-Einstein condensate, a mass of super-cooled subatomic particles. When detonated, they are capable of snap-freezing nearby targets.

High Explosive[]

High Explosive grenades are modified to maximize their blast radius and impact. They are particularly useful for blowing lightly-armored enemies, like Geth Troopers, out from cover; they also act as crowd control for large groups of enemies.
