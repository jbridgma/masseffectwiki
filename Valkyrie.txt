Description[]
After the carnage of the Battle of the Citadel, Alliance officers commissioned a new rifle for their ground forces. A variation of the popular Avenger design, the Valkyrie is now standard issue for new recruits. Exceptionally well-crafted, accurate, and packing ample firepower, the rifle is a hot black-market item when it surfaces.

Acquisition[]
The N7 Valkyrie is included in the N7 Warfare Gear pack as a retail bonus item for players who pre-ordered either edition of the game from certain retailers. It is also included in Mass Effect 3: Special Edition on Wii U.[1] An e-mail from EDI is received if the weapon was obtained from these sources.




Valkyrie Assault Rifle


From: EDI


The N7 Valkyrie assault rifle is issued to every new Alliance recruit and is standard issue among ground forces. Alliance telemetry shows the weapon displays excellent efficiency in combat. Since the Normandy is now an Alliance vessel, I was able to requisition a number of these rifles for use among the crew. You will find them in the weapons lockers. EDI



It is also available in Mass Effect 3: Omega (included in Legendary Edition), and can be found during The Invasion of Omega segment of the mission, if you don't already have it through the N7 Warfare Gear DLC. It can also be purchased as a single weapon upgrade level at Harrot's Emporium or at the Spectre Requisitions terminal on the Citadel for 7,000 credits; this upgrade will be available regardless of whether the weapon was already obtained.

Multiplayer
Weapons are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The N7 Valkyrie is categorized as ultra-rare and requires no multiplayer expansion packs.

Player Notes[]
GeneralMultiplayer 
General
Burst Fire: The Valkyrie is a semi-automatic burst-fire weapon; one two-round burst is fired per trigger pull, but the trigger can't be held to continuously fire. It is one of several similar such burst-fire rifle weapons, along with the M-15 Vindicator, the M-55 Argus, and the M-29 Incisor sniper rifle.
As with most burst-fire weapons, the weakness of the Valkyrie is recoil and crosshair bloom causing the second shot in the burst to be very inaccurate. For this reason, it's recommended to compensate by pulling your aim down with each trigger pull. Equipping an Assault Rifle Stability Damper or a scope mod is also effective. Firing from cover will increase both stability and accuracy and is highly recommended to get the most out of this weapon.
As with most burst-fire weapons, the Valkyrie doesn't have the rate of fire to be effective either in emergency close-quarters situations or for taking down heavy armored targets like Brutes and Atlases compared to fully automatic weapons or weapons with very powerful individual shots like the M-99 Saber.
Most burst weapons can be improved significantly with Marksman. Maximizing the rate of fire bonuses also works to increase accuracy as well, as the shots in the burst all fire before the muzzle has jumped as far.
The Valkyrie packs a decent punch, with each burst doing about the same damage as a shot from the M-6 Carnifex heavy pistol or the M-97 Viper sniper rifle. The Valkyrie is the heaviest of these weapons, but it fires slightly faster and can fire 8 bursts before having to reload by default, compared to the Viper and Carnifex that both only have 6 shots per clip.
The Valkyrie carries a large amount of spare thermal clips, which can give it an advantage over a more damaging weapon like the Cerberus Harrier that runs out of ammunition quickly.
Multiplayer
In an update, the Valkyrie had its base weight level (level I) decreased from 1.75-1.25 to 1.5-1.25.
It also now does 3x damage with headshots instead of 2.5x damage.
The Barrage Upgrade Gear and Stabilization Modules are handy to reduce recoil, which also serves to make burst weapons like the Valkyrie more accurate.
The Valkyrie's recoil can be drastically reduced by playing as a turian class or as the Geth Juggernaut Soldier and evolving the class power to increase stability. This makes it much easier to place every shot in the burst at the same location.
The N7 Valkyrie is a deadly weapon against infantry targets in the hands of classes specialized for headshot damage, such as the Turian Soldier or Quarian Marksman Soldier.

Description[]
A variant of the Avenger that fires two-round burst, the Valkyrie was once standard issue for new recruits to the Milky Way's Alliance military. The exceptionally well-crafted rifle is also a hot black market item. How the Andromeda Initiative procured a crate intended for N7-trained Alliance fighters remains a mystery.

Features[]
The singleplayer Valkyrie's Rank IX weight reverts back to its base Rank I weight. It drops down to 10 at Rank X.
The multiplayer Valkyrie mostly enjoyed improvements to damage, clip size, and max ammo during post-launch patching. However, its reload speed increased to 2.25 seconds (from 1.75 seconds) while its accuracy decreased to 60-75 (from 65-81).

Trivia[]

In July 2011, Harrison Krix, of Volpin Props was contracted by BioWare to produce a replica of the rifle, then known as simply the "N7 Rifle", in time for the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con. The process of making the model was detailed extensively on the Volpin Props website[2] and on Episode 26 of BioWare Pulse.[3]
