Description[]
When Dekuuna's government learned that the Reapers had returned, they evacuated everyone on Sangel's helium-3 recovery platforms. The sizable hydrogen-helium gas giant was abandoned, its workers relocated to Dekuuna. The move was ostensibly made because the elcor homeworld was a more defensible position. In reality, it may have been motivated by a subconscious herding instinct, as most grazing creatures come together in large groups when predators near.
