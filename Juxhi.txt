The planet Juxhi is a terrestrial world with two moons, Yando and Budmi. In the surrounding area of Juxhi's capital city Phend, there is a desert region with a rocky canyon.
In 2165, Saren Arterius travels to Juxhi on the trail of several Camala dock workers, who have stolen a weapons shipment from a turian freighter. He has tracked the sellers to an isolated warehouse on the outskirts of Phend, where they intend to sell the shipment to the Grim Skulls mercenary group. Saren easily wipes out both parties, then alerts the Phend authorities so they can recover the weapons and clean up the aftermath.
