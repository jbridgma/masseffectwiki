Characters present:

Commander Shepard
Nonya Tombiri
Characters optionally present:

Kaidan Alenko
Garrus Vakarian
Ashley Williams

Nonya Tombiri: Greetings. You're Shepard, right? The Spectre who just landed.

(Par) Commander Shepard. (Neu) Here I am. (Ren) Spectre? Me?  Shepard: I'm Shepard, Commanding Officer of the Alliance frigate SSV Normandy.Nonya Tombiri: Heh. Don't be so ceremonious. I am Nonya Tombiri, the administrator of this complex. We call it Throw Down. I'm glad they sent someone over to clean up. Everything is going down the drain here, I no longer hold any control over the platform. Shepard: You wanted to see me?Nonya Tombiri: I am Nonya Tombiri, the administrator of this complex. We call it Throw Down. I'm glad they sent someone over to clean up. Everything is going down the drain here, I no longer hold any control over the platform. Shepard: What makes you think I'm a Spectre?Nonya Tombiri: I looked up the Normandy's registry. "Assigned to the Citadel's Special Tactics and Reconnaissance." I am Nonya Tombiri, the administrator of this complex. We call it Throw Down. I'm glad they sent someone over to clean up. Everything is going down the drain here, I no longer hold any control over the platform.
(Par) I'll make time for you. (Neu) That's not my purpose. (Ren) I have bigger issues.  Shepard: I'll help out if I can, but I'm here to find Dr. Liara T'Soni. Shepard: You misunderstand. I'm here for Dr. Liara T'Soni. Shepard: I'm not here to fix your issues. I need to find Dr. Liara T'Soni.
Nonya Tombiri: The asari? Popular girl, that one. A krogan was also looking for her. Harrah, my security officer, had to talk him down.

(Par) He's a bounty hunter. (Neu) A krogan? (Ren) And your answer?  Shepard: I hope you didn't tell him where she was. Her life could be in danger.Nonya Tombiri: Her life? What the hell? Look, he rubbed me the wrong way and he was annoying. I told him I didn't know where T'Soni was. But of course I do know where she is. And you could take care of my problem on your way to her. Shepard: Wait. What krogan? When?Nonya Tombiri: He arrived last week on an alien-looking ship. He waved his gun around, asking where he could find Liara T'Soni. Look, he rubbed me the wrong way and he was annoying. I told him I didn' t know where T'Soni was. But of course I do know where she is. And you could take care of my problem on your way to her. Shepard: What did you tell him?Nonya Tombiri: Look, he rubbed me the wrong way and he was annoying. I told him I didn' t know where T'Soni was. But of course I do know where she is. And you could take care of my problem on your way to her.
(Par) I'm listening. (Neu) Explain first. (Ren) You're kidding me.  Shepard: Tell me what's bothering you.Nonya Tombiri: The leader of the Cartel is a creep named "Smiley". He holds Liara prisoner in his quarters. Shepard: Take care of what? I have no idea what you're talking about.Nonya Tombiri: The leader of the Cartel is a creep named "Smiley". He holds Liara prisoner in his quarters. Shepard: Look, I'm trying to save the galaxy.Nonya Tombiri: I know full well that Spectres don't deal in trivial matters. Let me explain. The leader of the Cartel is a creep named "Smiley". He holds Liara prisoner in his quarters.
(Par) What should I do? (Neu) I'll see to it. (Ren) Great. Some action.  Shepard: How do you suggest I proceed? Shepard: I'll take care of him. How would you rather have me do that? Shepard: Give me two hours and 2000 bullets, and I'll sweep the place clean.
Nonya Tombiri: Smiley isn't dumb. He's holed up in the infirmary, and only lets his brother Raciloma come in. With this code, you can activate the elevator to the refinery. Once there, look for Sessa Tarrent. She's a Union representative.

(Par) I'm on it. (Neu) Goodbye. (P Inv) Mako repairs (R Inv) Dealing with Smiley (Inv) Investigate  Shepard: Very well. I'll see what I can do.Nonya Tombiri: We're all counting on you, rest assured.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Nonya Tombiri: Nice to see you again, Spectre.(Return to last choice) Shepard: I'd better go.Nonya Tombiri: If you need anything, just ask.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Nonya Tombiri: Nice to see you again, Spectre.(Return to last choice) Shepard: Where can I find someone to do vehicle repairs?Nonya Tombiri: Charlie Booker, who runs the portmaster's office. I've heard you're already acquainted.(Return to last choice) Shepard: You gave me some advice on how to meet Smiley. Would you mind telling me again?Nonya Tombiri: You have to lure Raciloma out, and for that, you'll need to work for the Union. Go to the refinery and speak to their representative, her name is Sessa.(Return to last choice)
(Neu) Return (Inv) Law enforcement (Inv) Liara T'Soni (Inv) Bounty hunter (Inv) Cartel (Inv) Union  (Return to overarching choice) Shepard: Why hasn't your security service done anything about the Cartel?Nonya Tombiri: Harrah's my security service. The company didn't expect much trouble, a few pirates at most... but that's what the Navy is for, right?
(Ren) What happened? (P Inv) He's a wreck. (P Inv) I'm helping him. (P Inv) He's better now. (R Inv) Have him replaced.  (If Shepard heard about Harrah's past)Shepard: What do you know about his heartbreak?Nonya Tombiri: Nothing. There are two groups of people on this planet, Shepard. Those who accept their responsabilities, and those who don't. Who does their job here, me or Harrah? The only thing that the Union and the Cartel agree on, is that he's better off drunk. (If Harrah was met but not helped)Shepard: Being sober would do him some good.Nonya Tombiri: He used to be. Excellent shot, with a great sense of justice. He took that job because he wanted to, not for the money. He tries to keep it under control but he's constantly drinking and throwing up. Some time ago he got with a woman, but that didn't end well.(Return to overarching choice) (If Harrah is being helped)Shepard: I'm trying to help Harrah with his drinking problem.Nonya Tombiri: Don't waste so much time on him, you have the Cartel to take care of, right? The man has ingested so much alcohol he could outlive an asari.(Return to overarching choice) (If Harrah is sober)Shepard: I managed to get Harrah to quit the bottle.Nonya Tombiri: Great, but I'm not very fond of him. I can't stand people who shirk their duties. In any case, I don't think he'd be able to deal with the Cartel on his own. It's a good thing you're here.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: Ask your superiors for a new security officer.Nonya Tombiri: Before I can fire him, he would have to botch his work for a whole year. All I can do is have him fill a form that says: "I'm a damn drunkard and I'll try to get better in the next quarter." Shepard: What else can you tell me about Dr. T'Soni?Nonya Tombiri: She's an expert on Protheans, which is why she came here. This moon is full of Prothean ruins. She had to make a deal with the Cartel to move the artifacts off-world. That's how she must have been captured.
(P Inv) Why kidnap her?  Shepard: What do they want her for?Nonya Tombiri: No idea. Maybe she owes him money. Or maybe Smiley wanted to try out an asari.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: This krogan who was looking for Doctor T'Soni, where is he now?Nonya Tombiri: I suspect he's checking out the Prothean ruins. T'Soni is an archeologist after all. However there are hundreds of ruins on Caleston, so it might take a while. Shepard: I'd like to know more about the Cartel.Nonya Tombiri: It's run by a salarian everyone calls Smiley. His brother Raciloma acts as his second-in-command and bodyguard. Their drug is called red sand. They produce it here then sell it off to Earth. They give it to children.
(P Inv) Red sand? (R Inv) Who's Smiley?  Shepard: Tell me about the drug the Cartel makes.Nonya Tombiri: They say it was invented by the Mars Triads. It's a by-product of eezo. It triggers a biotic response. Makes you feel good, and maybe allows you to make a pen float a couple inches off the ground.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: I want to know more about Smiley.Nonya Tombiri: Devious little bastard, with a couple screws loose. Seems he never recovered from seeing his clan wiped out by an earthquake. He thinks he's some champion of the poor. He ships the red sand to Earth and claims he only sells it to the rich. He must think everyone there is rich.
(R Inv) Earth? Rich? Yeah, right.  (Only if Shepard is Earthborn)Shepard: I'm from Earth. I could have set him straight.Nonya Tombiri: So I've heard. My parents moved us out of the Dakar metroplex when I was six. I only remember huge buildings, police sirens and a lot of smog.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: I'd like to know more about the Union.Nonya Tombiri: They run the bar's smuggling, gambling and prostitution ring. The entertainment, in short.
(P Inv) Who leads it? (R Inv) You're awfully lax.  Shepard: Who runs the whole thing?Nonya Tombiri: The Union chairman. He's always locked up in his office at the refinery, no doubt to maintain secrecy. Shepard: And you just let them?Nonya Tombiri: It is a necessary evil. The hours here seem endless, work is hard, and the whole moon smells terrible. There have been some blackmail issues with the Miners' Union, but we eventually reached a compromise. The people need to blow off steam, forget their problems. Do you know how much the crime rate dropped after the Union arrived?| Ashley Williams: It's not just illegal, it's immoral.| Kaidan Alenko: It's not just illegal, it's immoral.| Garrus Vakarian: You can't just ignore the law when you see fit.Nonya Tombiri: You may think what you want, but I'm the one who has to keep people happy when they work for six months straight in a suffocating, smelly mining station. Most people come here to make an honest living. The miners and refinery workers are decent folks.
(R Inv) Blackmail?  Shepard: Didn't you say the Union blackmailed you?Nonya Tombiri: They can behave if you give them enough space. Before the Cartel came, they kept things stable enough around here. Then six months ago, a salarian drug cartel took over the refinery. They've been butting heads with the Union ever since. But I said we should do something about the Cartel. And the Union was willing to cooperate to that end.(Return to overarching choice)

(Par) I work for Tombiri. (Neu) Goodbye. (Ren) Let me through.  Shepard: The administrator sent me to talk to Sessa.Fred Mazzei: What, she thinks she can just... Shepard: I'm just passing through, don't mind me.Fred Mazzei: Yeah, sure. Watch your step over there. The stuff in those vats can melt your face off. I've seen it happen. It was pretty funny.Sessa Tarrent: Fred. You're here to work, not chat.Fred Mazzei: Yeah, alright.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Fred Mazzei: You can't just... What do you want?(Return to last choice) Shepard: I'm here to talk to your boss, so get out of my way.
Sessa Tarrent: You're Shepard? I knew your face seemed familiar, Commander. Useful thing, the extranet. My Spider VI only took a few seconds to fetch your data.

(Par) Impressive. (Neu) So what do you think? (Ren) Who cares?  Shepard: You have me at a disadvantage.
(Sole Survivor) (War Hero) (Ruthless)  Sessa Tarrent: I'm a freelance mercenary, there's nothing more to it. You, however, are a different story. The universe is a better place without those batarian slave traders. I would have done the same. You have qualities which would be useful to me. If you turn a blind eye, I'll do the same.

(Neu) Very well. (Inv) I don't see the point.  Shepard: What will I need to do exactly?Sessa Tarrent: The same as all the others: complete the mission. The Cartel knows we found their cache. Make sure they don't get in our way. Shepard: And how does that get me inside Smiley's quarters?Sessa Tarrent: It doesn't. But if we can hit them, it will force Raciloma, Smiley's brother, to negotiate with me. The Cartel knows we found their cache. Make sure they don't get in our way.

Fred Mazzei: I know exactly what you mean. As soon as you're done putting on your environmental suit, only then you realize you gotta run straight to the bathroom. And then you try opening all the zippers while you run, but also you gotta be careful when the upper part starts falling down to your knees, because then it becomes harder to run.

(Par) Wha-- (Neu) I-- (Ren) Don't--  Shepard: Uhh... Shepard: I should... Shepard: [sigh]
Fred Mazzei: And then you finally get there with your suit in one hand and your helmet in the other, so you gotta headbutt the door open, and that's when you...
Sessa Tarrent: Fred. Shut up.
Fred Mazzei: What? What did I do? I'm just talking, is all.
Sessa Tarrent: Fred, go to the garage and get ready for a field assignment. You think you can do that?

(Par) Of course. (Neu) I'm listening. (Ren) There's no time.  Shepard: You don't need my permission to speak your mind.| Kaidan Alenko: We're working for criminals. Is there no other way to get to T'Soni?| Garrus Vakarian: (Depending on outcome of Garrus: Find Dr. Saleon) [Regulations say otherwise. Sorry./It's very kind of you. But I had to ask anyway.] We're working for criminals, when we should be rounding them up.| Tali'Zorah: Oh, I'm the only one here not in the military. I thought I should ask. I've seen groups like the Union before. I don't like working for them.| Ashley Williams: All right. Glad to hear it. We're working for criminals here. Is this morally right?

Thank you for hearing me out.| Tali'Zorah: I'm feeling a little better, thanks.| Ashley Williams: Got it. Thanks for hearing me out. Shepard: We need to get to Dr. T'Soni before Saren does.

I apologize.| Tali'Zorah: Well, you must be in command for a reason.| Ashley Williams: Your orders, Commander. Shepard: If a city was occupied by the enemy, shouldn't we bomb it?

Fred Mazzei: Hey. It's... good to be working with you. The bore is just over here. When I joined the Union, I thought... Well, when I worked on the belts, people always came to me for advice. Take Sessa for instance. You've seen it, right? Always saying "Shut up, Fred!" She thinks I'm no good for anything.

(Par) Don't give up. (Neu) You should quit. (Ren) She's right. Let's go.  Shepard: You just need to show her what you're capable of.Fred Mazzei: Yeah, right. Only she'll never let me have that chance. I can't prove my worth by shaking down some jellyfish. They're just too slimy.
(Par) Let me do it. (Neu) Persevere. (Ren) You're pathetic.  Shepard: I could get the credits from Oronath for you.Fred Mazzei: For real? You'd be doing me a solid... uh, whatever it is. Shepard: You just need to show them what you can do.Fred Mazzei: Yeah... But nobody will give me the chance, right? Shepard: Collecting extortion money is for chumps.Fred Mazzei: Extor-- No, no no! They're dues. All unions charge dues, right? Shepard: If you want to be respected for your skills, the Union's not for you.Fred Mazzei: Maybe I'm not cut out for this job. I should just... go to space.
(Par) Yes, it's beautiful. (Neu) Persevere. (Ren) I don't care.  (Only if Shepard has the Spacer background)Shepard: Space has a purity that planets don't have. Perfect momentum, precise movements.Fred Mazzei: Yeah, if I was in space, I'd be all like "weee-yahoo-waatchaa!" But down here, I'm like a fish out of its league. You think I should leave this place? Another job, that'd be... I know a thing or two. And I'm good at interviews. Shepard: You just need to show them what you can do.Fred Mazzei: Yeah... But nobody will give me the chance, right? Shepard: It makes no difference if you work on the ground or in vacuum. It's that simple.Fred Mazzei: I guess. But the Union doesn't really care what I do as a miner. Shepard: I don't have time to deal with your problems, we have a job to do.Fred Mazzei: Okay, sure, I'll shut up! I know when it's time to be quiet, when it's time to move on.
Human mercenary: Get a move on, Fred. We've been here for too long.
Fred Mazzei: I've worked on these Tenkara Corp drills before. They're easy to rig. I just need to tinker with this thing for a bit.
Human mercenary: What thing?
Fred Mazzei: That thing, there. That thing! That thing right there.
Turian mercenary: How about you take a hike, Mazzei?
Fred Mazzei: How about you try to hike your kicked ass out of my foot up your butt in-- I mean, you take a hike!
Turian mercenary: Hey, rookie. You want to die here, by any chance? Get out now.

(Par) I've fought worse. (Neu) Try it. (Ren) Shut up, Fred.  Shepard: That might work with the miners, but we've encountered geth up close.Turian mercenary: No regular soldier could have fought the geth. Have you heard of Raciloma Amnoss? He's the Cartel's number two guy. One of the best killers in the galaxy. The assassination of the Zedor minister, Kurinar 7, that was him. Shepard: You're not going to kill me.Turian mercenary: That's what the last guy said too. Have you heard of Raciloma Amnoss? He's the Cartel's number two guy. One of the best killers in the galaxy. The assassination of the Zedor minister, Kurinar 7, that was him. Shepard: Well, that was... something. Very intimidating. But it won't do.Turian mercenary: Have you heard of Raciloma Amnoss? He's the Cartel's number two guy. One of the best killers in the galaxy. The assassination of the Zedor minister, Kurinar 7, that was him.
Human mercenary: So? Aramus hired Sessa Tarrent. She took out that asari admiral, Altaia. Shot her on Yormea.
Turian mercenary: If she's so good, why hasn't she killed Raciloma?
| Ashley Williams: My dad can blow your dad's head off.
| Urdnot Wrex: This is embarrassing. Can we kill them?
| Garrus Vakarian: Murder as a contest.
| Tali'Zorah: I didn't know hired killers were so competitive.
Turian mercenary: Go back to Throw Down. Otherwise, the last thing you'll ever smell is the sulfur dioxide entering your suit.
Miner: Erm, look guys. We don't want to get dragged into this. Maybe you could go somewhere else?
Turian mercenary: Shut up.

(Par) In your dreams. (Neu) Tough words. (Ren) Raciloma will die too. (Cha) Don't touch the miners. (Int) Just try it.  Shepard: And let you keep the drugs, so you can sell them to kids?Turian mercenary: Do I look like a dealer? What the Cartel does with it is not my concern. Shepard: And I'm supposed to believe you?Turian mercenary: I don't want to waste bullets if I can help it. Shepard: You think Raciloma could take us on? Bring him.Turian mercenary: You want to meet Raciloma? Your funeral. Let's go.| Urdnot Wrex: Let me take out one of them. Just one. He won't be missed.| Ashley Williams: You guys had better turn around and leave.| Garrus Vakarian: Sure, I can't wait to meet him in person.| Kaidan Alenko: You guys had better turn around and leave. Shepard: If you intend to hurt them, you're going to have to deal with me first.| Urdnot Wrex: I say we kill them anyway. Just to be safe.| Ashley Williams: You don't want to try and find out.| Garrus Vakarian: This isn't a good day to die, right?| Kaidan Alenko: Just say the word.Turian mercenary: You haven't won. We'll be back with reinforcements. Shepard: I won't let you hurt anyone here. Leave, or we'll kill you.| Urdnot Wrex: I say we kill them anyway. Just to be safe.| Ashley Williams: You don't want to try and find out.| Garrus Vakarian: This isn't a good day to die, right?| Kaidan Alenko: Just say the word.Turian mercenary: You haven't won.

Sessa Tarrent: Is the job done?

(Par) It was hard. (Neu) Yes. (Ren) Duh.  Shepard: Yes, but we ran into the Cartel.Sessa Tarrent: Since you're alive and well, I assume you've remedied the issue. Standard Union rate for this is 500 credits. The Union needs violent types, especially since the Cartel set itself up here. Shepard: The job is done.Sessa Tarrent: Excellent. I like getting results. Standard Union rate for this is 500 credits. The Union needs violent types, especially since the Cartel set itself up here. Shepard: Of course it is. Don't you trust me?Sessa Tarrent: I trust only two people: God, and myself. And you don't look like the former. Standard Union rate for this is 500 credits. The Union needs violent types, especially since the Cartel set itself up here.
(Neu) I'll take the 500. (Int) It's not enough. (Inv) What about Fred?  Shepard: I will spend them wisely.Sessa Tarrent: You can't go wrong with hollow-point rounds.

Smiley: Hello, Spectre. I was waiting for you. You killed my brother.

(Par) You must have a story. (Neu) You know me? (Ren) That I did.  Shepard: How did you end up doing this?Smiley: An earthquake. Most of my clan was buried under the rubble. I did what I had to do. I couldn't let Raciloma starve. That's why I only sell to the rich, and donate the money. I know what it means to be hungry.| Garrus Vakarian: I wonder what prompted the change in career, from commando to drug lord.| Kaidan Alenko: Sounds fun.| Tali'Zorah: Sounds fun.| Urdnot Wrex: Your job's actually child's play.Smiley: Indeed. Why did you kill my brother? We haven't done anything to you. Shepard: What makes you think I'm a Spectre?Smiley: An organization like mine needs to keep an ear to the ground. Couldn't stay in business otherwise. I've always wanted to meet a Spectre. You were my heroes when I was a kid. We used to play Spectres and pirates by the old pond. Why did you kill my brother? We haven't done anything to you. Shepard: It's nice to feel appreciated.Smiley: Too bad we didn't meet under different circumstances. But I can't forgive you for what you did to Racil.| Garrus Vakarian: Think this through. Raciloma can't save you anymore.| Ashley Williams: Think this through. Raciloma can't save you anymore.| Urdnot Wrex: Think this through. Raciloma can't save you anymore.| Kaidan Alenko: Your brother can't save you anymore. There's no need to shed any more blood.Smiley: Why did you kill my brother? We haven't done anything to you.
(Par) You're wicked. (Neu) I'm here for T'Soni. (Ren) Prepare to join him.  Shepard: You're making drugs, and you've kidnapped Liara T'Soni.Smiley: Smiley: What? What are you talking about?
(Neu) Drop the act. (Neu) I'm here for T'Soni. (Ren) Stop it.  Shepard: Don't get coy with me. You kidnapped Liara T'Soni.Smiley: What? No, I... I mean, do you see her here? Shepard: I didn't come for you. I want Dr. T'Soni free.Smiley: Smiley: Free her? How so? Where is she? Did the krogan kidnap her? Shepard: Don't play dumb with me.Smiley: I'm not playing dumb. For all I know, she's gone to an archaeological digsite. Shepard: I didn't come for you. I want Dr. T'Soni free.Smiley: Smiley: Free her? How so? Where is she? Did the krogan kidnap her?
(Par) Wait, really? (Neu) Erm... (Ren) Stop it.  Shepard: You don't know?Smiley: No. She's missing? Shepard: No, you did.Smiley: What? No, I... I mean, do you see her here? Shepard: Don't play dumb with me.Smiley: I'm not playing dumb. For all I know, she's gone to an archaeological digsite. Shepard: Yes, I killed Raciloma. And you're next. Does that upset you?Smiley: Oh yes. I'm going to make you pay. But it's so... Ruajet!(End of conversation)
(Par) So you do know her? (Neu) Tombiri was clear. (Ren) I'm done talking.  Shepard: When did you last see her?Smiley: Last time was when she asked us to transport some of her artifacts. Ah, of course. Damn, what an idiot. Tombiri, she made a fool of you. She's the chairman of the Miners' Union. She used you to eliminate me.| Tali'Zorah: Tombiri is the chairman of the Union? She's a criminal?| Garrus Vakarian: Tombiri is the chairman of the Union? My intuition's getting rusty.| Ashley Williams: I think we should have a word with Tombiri, Commander.| Kaidan Alenko: The administrator is also chairman of the Union? Shepard: I was told you had T'Soni.Smiley: Ah, of course. Damn, what an idiot. Tombiri, she made a fool of you. She's the chairman of the Miners' Union. She used you to eliminate me.| Tali'Zorah: Tombiri is the chairman of the Union? She's a criminal?| Garrus Vakarian: Tombiri is the chairman of the Union? My intuition's getting rusty.| Ashley Williams: I think we should have a word with Tombiri, Commander.| Kaidan Alenko: The administrator is also chairman of the Union? Shepard: I'm going to count to three.Smiley: Wait. Let me think. Ah, of course. Damn, what an idiot. Tombiri, she made a fool of you. She's the chairman of the Miners' Union. She used you to eliminate me.| Tali'Zorah: Tombiri is the chairman of the Union? She's a criminal?| Garrus Vakarian: Tombiri is the chairman of the Union? My intuition's getting rusty.| Ashley Williams: I think we should have a word with Tombiri, Commander.| Kaidan Alenko: The administrator is also chairman of the Union?

Shepard: Enlighten me.Smiley: I do know where Liara is. I might tell you, just to annoy Nonya. Shepard: Nobody makes a fool of me.Smiley: I do know where Liara is. I might tell you, just to annoy Nonya.
(Par) I'll take care of her. (Neu) You're on borrowed time. (Ren) [Rough him up] (Cha) You're gambling too much. (Int) I have a better deal.  Shepard: We have unfinished business.

This wasn't supposed to happen... Shepard: Thank you. We'll hand you over to Harrah. But first, I'll have a chat with Tombiri.Smiley: I only give people what they want. The workers love me. They won't let you.

Sessa Tarrent: Is Smiley dead?

(Par) That's quite a crowd. (Neu) He's dealt with. (Ren) Why the deception?  Shepard: Why all the backup, Miss Tarrent?Sessa Tarrent: I assume that was a rhetorical question. You can't be so dumb. I enjoy working with reliable people. Unfortunately, I have contracts of my own to fulfill. (If Smiley was killed)Shepard: He's dead.Sessa Tarrent: I enjoy working with reliable people. Unfortunately, I have contracts of my own to fulfill.(If Smiley was arrested)Shepard: I arrested him. He's out of the picture.Sessa Tarrent: It's all that matters. We'll take care of him later. I enjoy working with reliable people. Unfortunately, I have contracts of my own to fulfill. Shepard: You lied to me. Tombiri is the chairman of the Union.Sessa Tarrent: I've never claimed otherwise. But she is very grateful for your work. I enjoy working with reliable people. Unfortunately, I have contracts of my own to fulfill.
| Garrus Vakarian: I don't like this, Commander.
| Urdnot Wrex: That's a lot of guns.
| Kaidan Alenko: I don't like this, Commander.
| Ashley Williams: I don't like this, Commander.

(Par) You betrayed Racil too. (Neu) You're so selfish. (Ren) Go home. (Inv) Why do this?  Shepard: You cared about Raciloma. Why work for someone who ordered you to kill him? Shepard: Even now, you value your reputation more than Raciloma? Shepard: You've killed enough for today, find yourself another client. Shepard: Now that you got what you wanted, we're expendable?Sessa Tarrent: I just kill if I need to. Says so in my contract.(Return to last choice)
Sessa Tarrent: I don't know what you mean. I get hired to do a job, my feelings are irrelevant. My reputation is all I have.

Nonya Tombiri: Hey, Shepard. How's the investigation going? Made any progress?

(Par) Start talking. (Neu) You used me. (Ren) I sure have.  Shepard: You have a lot to explain.Nonya Tombiri: How about we start with Dr. T'Soni? I know where she is. But I guess that's the only thing keeping me alive. Here's what I propose. I tell you where she is, and you let me stay in charge here. Leave as if nothing had happened. Shepard: I've done your dirty laundry. Now tell me where Liara is.Nonya Tombiri: If I were a woman of her word, I would. But you know I'm a liar and a crook. Here's what I propose. I tell you where she is, and you let me stay in charge here. Leave as if nothing had happened. Shepard: Shut up.Nonya Tombiri: Hey, hey! I can help you! I know where T'Soni is! Calm down, alright? Here's what I propose. I tell you where she is, and you let me stay in charge here. Leave as if nothing had happened.

(Par) I already know. (Neu) Too late. (Ren) Oopsie.  Shepard: Smiley told me where Dr. T'Soni is. Shepard: Smiley already told me where she is. Shepard: That's too bad. Smiley already told me where to find her.
Nonya Tombiri: Fantastic. I have nothing more to offer you. What will you do now, Shepard?

She was his weakness, just as T'Soni is yours.(Return to last choice) Shepard: Where's Knossos?Nonya Tombiri: About a hundred kilometers from here, in the Ring of Fire.

Commander Shepard
Unnamed human male assassin

Assassin: That'd be far enough, Commander Shepard.

(Par) Hello. (Neu) Excuse me? (Ren) Scram.  Shepard: Who is this?Assassin: Agent Saren hired us. Not that we like him, it's just a business relationship. We got a contract with your name on it. I'm sorry about that, but I'm the sheriff, not the senator. Shepard: Says who?Assasssin: Says agent Saren. He hired us to look for you. We got a contract with your name on it. I'm sorry about that, but I'm the sheriff, not the senator. Shepard: I don't have time to lose with you.Assassin: We'll see about that. We got a contract with your name on it. I'm sorry about that, but I'm the sheriff, not the senator.
(Par) Let's talk. (Neu) You'd betray humanity? (Ren) Tough luck. (Inv) Employed by Saren  Shepard: I can offer you a more profitable contract.Assassin: I don't think so. Saren's put a lot of zeroes at the end of your name.
(Par) We're still talking. (Neu) You'd betray humanity? (Ren) Tough luck.  Shepard: So why are we making conversation?Assassin: Professional courtesy. I don't have anything against Spectres; we do pretty much the same work. Don't get me wrong. I've got people all over this ravine. You try to run, they'll end you. Now let us do this quick and clean. One shot, one kill. If not, I can't guarantee you an open-casket wake. Shepard: Humans, working for the geth?Assassin: Nah, I'm not fond of those clockwork sons of bitches my own self. Don't get me wrong. I've got people all over this ravine. You try to run, they'll end you. Now let us do this quick and clean. One shot, one kill. If not, I can't guarantee you an open-casket wake. Shepard: You should have read the fine prints. I don't intend to die today.Assassin: Yeah, who ever does. Don't get me wrong. I've got people all over this ravine. You try to run, they'll end you. Now let us do this quick and clean. One shot, one kill. If not, I can't guarantee you an open-casket wake. Shepard: Humans, working for the geth?Assassin: Nah, I'm not fond of those clockwork sons of bitches my own self. Don't get me wrong. I've got people all over this ravine. You try to run, they'll end you. Now let us do this quick and clean. One shot, one kill. If not, I can't guarantee you an open-casket wake. Shepard: You should have read the fine prints.

One shot, one kill. If not, I can't guarantee you an open-casket wake. Shepard: Saren has a billion geth and krogan under his command.Assassin: I wondered about that myself. If you have an army, you generally don't order out for one. Krogan and geth attract attention. He wants you found wherever you go. Here, the Citadel, or wherever.(Return to last choice)
(Par) Too bad. (Neu) You're crazy. (Ren) This is boring.  Shepard: Then I'm going to make you earn your payday.Assassin: Good on you. I'll do the same myself. Let's get to it, boys! Shepard: Only an idiot would willingly get shot.Assassin: That's what I think. No offense intended, just trying to do right by you. Let's get to it, boys! Shepard: Do you plan on using those guns, or are you going to talk me to death?Assassin: Fair enough. Let's get to it, boys!
