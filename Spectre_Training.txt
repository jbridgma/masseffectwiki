This is one of the most important talents in the game. It is only available to Shepard after Spectre Training, and, unless you've specialised as a Medic, Unity is the only way to revive fallen squadmates mid-fight. During long battles, if Unity isn't maxed out, you may need to quickly follow it up with the Shield Boost, Barrier, Immunity, or First Aid talents to keep your squadmates from getting killed immediately again. The Adrenaline Boost ability can be used to instantly recharge Unity, a great way to circumvent its otherwise long cooldown time.
