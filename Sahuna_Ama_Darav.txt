After completing the two missions above there is an email from Jaal inviting Ryder to meet Sahuna Ama Darav the next time they are on Havarl. Acknowledging the email starts the mission.




Meet My True Mother 
To: Ryder
From: Jaal

Ryder,

I've been telling my family about you and my time on the Tempest. I'd love for you to meet them and see where I grew up.

My true mother, Sahuna, is especially interested in meeting you. Next time we're on Havarl, let's stop by.


Jaal


Accompany Jaal to Havarl[]
Head to Pelaav Research Station on Havarl and the navpoint  leads to an Angaran Shuttle. Take the shuttle to Jaal's childhood home to meet his mother and numerous siblings.
You will be given an interrupt to hug Sahuna just after meeting her. Sahuna says that Jaal is her favorite and then proceeds to list Jaal's hobbies and pursuits. Sahuna then says she has to leave and is late for a Resistance meeting.
Jaal explains that each child is Sahuna's favorite. Next you meet the extended family and learn a little bit about Jaal's past.
Jaal then shows Ryder his room, a kett weapon he dismantled as a child, a kaerkyn that he also dismantled, and activates a star map that lightens up the room. Jaal says he wants to take that apart as well.
If you have flirted with Jaal before, there is now an opportunity to deepen the relationship.

Aftermath[]
Several emails will arrive after this mission.
If the relationship with Jaal is platonic:




Communication from Jaal
To: Ryder
From: Jaal

Ryder,


Thank you for visiting my family with me. For someone with such a small family, it must have been overwhelming, but you didn't show it at all.


If the relationship with Jaal is romantic:




Communication from Jaal
To: Ryder
From: Jaal

Ryder,

Thank you for visiting my family with me. For someone with such a small family, it must have been overwhelming, but you didn't show it at all.

I'm so amazed that you confessed to having feelings for me like I do for you. I feel lucky, and also scared and excited.
How unlikely is it that you traveled from another galaxy to come into my life? I'm humbled.

Yours,

Your Darling Jaal


Sahuna will send three emails all with the same title.





Communication from Sahuna, True Mother of Jaal
To: Ryder
From: Sahuna

Do you like pie?

I secured some food books from your home planet of Earth. Disappointingly, the other mothers aren't impressed with the flavor.

I hope you like pie.


Sahuna Ama Darav







Communication from Sahuna, True Mother of Jaal
To: Ryder
From: Sahuna

Jaal refuses to send me the answers to the questions below. He says that it's too embarrassing, so I am asking you, myself.

- Do you have a favorite weapon that you find particularly effective against the kett?
- What was your homeworld like? Perhaps we can find ways to make you feel more at home here.
- Can you describe the human birth process to me? I'm interested for many obvious reasons.

I'm never embarrassed. That's something you should know about me.


Sahuna Ama Darav







Communication from Sahuna, True Mother of Jaal
To: Ryder
From: Sahuna

I hear good news from Jaal that you and he are serious about your relationship with one another.

I say "good news," but warn you that some people will find this alien match offensive. You MUST ignore them and give them no more thought than I have, which is already too much. It's a challenge and a gift to break boundaries. 

Now, please forward to me your health documents and the personal narrative of your early years at your soonest convenience.


Sahuna Ama Darav
