Description[]
A strange island of peace in the lawless Terminus Systems, Thunawanuro is a planet of crushing gravity but abundant life. As its ponderous name indicates, it was colonized by the elcor, who have several booming industries on the planet. Hydroelectric dams and biofuels from tough woody algae provide much of the planet's energy. Mines export uranium, thorium, and gold taken to space with generous use of mass effect fields. Of course, pirates target the elcor's shipping as soon as it leaves orbit, but the elcor's deals with mercenary companies keep away all but the most foolhardy of attackers.
