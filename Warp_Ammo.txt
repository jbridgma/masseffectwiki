Player Notes[]
Warp Ammo bonus damage is doubled against enemies ragdolled by biotics. For example, Rank 1 Warp Ammo has a 15% bonus damage, which is doubled to 30% against ragdolled enemies. However, the regular damage of any weapon is doubled against ragdolled (and frozen) enemies regardless of ammo type used.[1]
Warp Ammo does not appear to deal any additional damage against targets affected by non-physics-based biotic powers such as Reave or Dominate.
Warp Ammo is the only ammo power in Mass Effect 2 that deals bonus damage to barriers. As such, it is the best ammo power to use if attempting to one-shot or snipe barriered enemies due to how damage from weapons is applied in the game. The damage increase from an ammo power is applied to the entire damage of a single shot (e.g. from a sniper rifle) and is calculated based on the type of the first protection layer damaged, even if that layer is minimal and most of the damage bleeds through to the health or armor underneath.

Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Warp Ammo deals 2x damage to barriers.[2]
Upgrades to power damage will increase Warp Ammo's listed damage bonus against armor and health. Damage to barriers, armor weakening and lifted target damage are only dependent on the evolutions taken in Warp Ammo.
The Rank 6 Weapon Master evolution of the Soldier's Combat Mastery will increase Warp Ammo's damage against all protection types including barriers.
Care should be used when choosing the rank 4 Squad Bonus if other squad members are using ammo powers as then activating an ammo power with the Squad Bonus will override other squad members' ammo powers. You can tell which ammo power is actually active based on the icon appearing over your gun.
The ammunition capacity boost, if chosen, only applies on the active ammo power. Switching to another ammo power will remove the extra ammunition even if both have the capacity boost.
The armor weakening effect is party-friendly; it creates a short-duration debuff (about two seconds or so) that other players or squadmates can benefit from.[3] The debuff reduces the damage reduction provided by the armor (yellow bar) of targets such as Atlases, Ravagers or Geth Pyros by the percentage listed. This especially benefits weapons with smaller damage per round but a relatively high rate of fire.
The armor-weakening effect of Warp Rounds in multiplayer also benefits allies.
Since Patch 1.04, the "lifted target" damage bonus applies not just on targets that have been physically suspended in the air, but on all enemies primed for Biotic Explosions, such as any target affected by Warp, Reave, or Dark Channel, or targets held in Stasis. The "lifted target damage" value then serves as a weapon damage multiplier based on the basic health/armor/barrier damage bonus that Warp Ammo provides by default. For example, if one selects the rank 6 damage evolution, Warp Ammo's armor damage bonus is 40%; its actual damage bonus against "lifted" armored foes will be: 40*(1+0.75) = 70%.
Warp Ammo can deal additional damage to shields as long as the shielded target is primed for a biotic combo, though Warp Ammo has no damage modifier against shields by default.
The above also applies to Warp Rounds in multiplayer.
Warp Ammo has a limited ability to in effect "bypass" the shield gate mechanic of enemies protected by barriers due to how ammo power bonus damage is applied in Mass Effect 3. For a full explanation, see the Notes section for Disruptor Ammo.
Strategies
Warp Ammo is obviously most effective in biotic-heavy parties to take maximum advantage of its bonus damage to targets affected by biotics.
Try equipping Liara with the Scorpion heavy pistol. The Scorpion has a high chance of triggering the effects of ammo powers often, and the Scorpion's rounds can deal bonus damage to multiple clustered targets lifted by biotics—devastating against enemies caught in Liara's Singularities or her Stasis with the Bubble evolution.
Warp Ammo is the only ammo power effective against both barriers and armor, making it extremely efficient against Banshees, Adjutants, and Praetorians.
