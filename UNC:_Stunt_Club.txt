UNC: Stunt Club was a series of assignments for Mass Effect which were cut during development. They involved reaching a number of "markers" on the surface of certain worlds.

Acquisition[]
Each separate instance of this assignment could be started by finding any one of the 30 markers on a given planet.

Plotline[]
Once this assignment has been initiated, Commander Shepard would have to travel to the other 29 markers on the same planet using the M35 Mako. When all the markers have been found, the assignment for the planet would be complete.
