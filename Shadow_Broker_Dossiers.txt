The Shadow Broker keeps dossiers on entities of interest. One terminal on the Shadow Broker Base holds information on Commander Shepard's squad, several other prominent figures, and a few others. These files can be reviewed anytime after Liara T'Soni's takeover of the base.
Most dossier entries are available on first access. However, some are unlocked through certain conditions like being a love interest or completion of a squadmate's loyalty mission.
Please note: These entries are quoted verbatim from the game and should be kept pristine. Edits and updates should be placed on non-Dossier pages relating to the same subject (i.e. don't update the Cerberus Dossier, update the Cerberus article instead).
