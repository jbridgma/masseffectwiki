Description[]
Damkianna, as the main source of helium-3 in the Maskim Xul system, is orbited by abandoned recovery stations that the rachni built during their days of conquest. Because the rachni trusted in their high tolerance for radiation, the stations were poorly shielded against cosmic rays and have deteriorated over time. The Citadel species built their own stations during the Rachni War, several of which have been maintained to this day.

Trivia[]
Damkianna appears to be a Mesopotamian mother-goddess who's consort to either Enki or Marduk.
