Character present:

Unnamed human male or female miner

Miner: Have you heard about the krogan? He was waving his gun around, asking where he'd find some asari bitch.

Miner: If you ask me, ever since the Cartel arrived, the Union has been going downhill.

Miner: At least the Union people were like us. Not like those mercs from the Cartel.

Miner: If Harrah didn't drink himself into oblivion, maybe things would be different here.

Miner: You want some advice? Get off this rock as soon as you can.

Miner: You'll get used to the smell. Or at least you won't smell anything at all.

Miner: Rumor has it they're using our eezo to build the engine for the Alliance's new dreadnought.

(Male miner to male Shepard only)
Miner: If you've got the urge, try the girls at the Seventh Moon. But stay away from Tatiana.

(Male miner to female Shepard only)
Miner: You smell nice. I mean, you don't smell like rotten eggs. I mean, you must be new around here. Maybe I'll see you around.

(Female miner to male Shepard only)
Miner: Are you a new arrival? Just ask me if you need any help.

(Female miner to female Shepard only)
Miner: Are you new here? I hope you're not shy. We all shower together here.

(During the course of Caleston: Redemption)
Miner: I've heard Harrah wants to quit drinking. He used to be a good man.

(During the course of Caleston: Last Man Standing)
Miner: You're here for the money? Why don't you leave us alone?

Miner: I don't want any part of it.

Miner: One of my friends went missing last week. I told her she should've paid Sessa's men.

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Redemption, if Harrah survived)
Miner: Some people say that Harrah and Tatiana are getting married.

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Redemption, if Harrah died)
Miner: I guess we need a new security officer.

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Last Man Standing)
Miner: At least there weren't any shootouts on the main level before you arrived.

Miner: The Citadel sent you to take down the Cartel? As if we needed the aliens policing us.

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Last Man Standing, if Tombiri was eliminated)
Miner: With the Union gone, the company will surely screw us over.

Character present:

Unnamed human male miner

Miner: If Eldfell-Ashland cared about their workers, they'd do something to solve our problems.

Miner: If you have problems, you'd better sort them out yourself. The EAE security guard's a drunken wreck.

Miner: If I had money, I'd leave. This is like working in a flaming garbage dump.

Miner: Sometimes I just like to watch the eezo containers coming and going.

Miner: Some say the geth have been sighted beyond the Veil. It's just a rumor, right?

Miner: What time is it? The shifts at the refinery are so long I lose track.

Miner: I just got off a twelve-hour shift. I don't even have the strength to go to the Seventh Moon.

Miner: Recently more and more krogan have been coming through here. I wonder why that is.

Miner: Were you there when that krogan came? He almost blew Harrah's head off.

Miner: Since the Cartel arrived, there's been a lot more aliens around. You think they like our food?

(During the course of Caleston: Redemption)
Miner: I actually saw Jason Harrah walking straight earlier. I think he had even shaved a little.

(During the course of Caleston: Last Man Standing)
Miner: I don't want any trouble.

Miner: Find someone else to bother.

Miner: I've already paid up for this month.

Miner: I don't want any part of it.

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Redemption, if Harrah survived)
Miner: Harrah seems to have made it eventually.

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Redemption, if Harrah died)
Miner: It's too bad about Harrah. Everyone thought his liver would give out before the gang war ended.

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Last Man Standing)
Miner: The Cartel's the perfect example why we shouldn't deal with aliens. They just want to get rid of us.

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Last Man Standing, if Tombiri was eliminated)
Miner: Without crime, this place is gonna be just another crappy corporate station like any other.

Miner: Everyone's afraid the company might take our retirement funds to make up for lost profits.

Character present:

Unnamed human male patron

Human patron: Ever since the Cartel settled, this place is crawling with turians. Those bastards just get on my nerves.

Human patron: I heard a krogan came by last week, looking for the asari.

Human patron: Those damned mercenaries think they're better than us... The Union should do something.

Human patron: You think Harrah will show up today? He usually comes for a drink in the afternoon.

Human patron: I've just got through a 10-hour shift. I came here to drink, not to talk.

Human patron: Don't ask Ruushok for beer. He'll either serve you pure alcohol, or throw you out.

Human patron: Nothing like a nice cold drink in here after a hard day's work. Not in these parts, anyway.

Human patron: Unless you're buying me a round, I'm not interested.

Human patron: We haven't had a good brawl for ages. That's probably why Ruushok is so grumpy.

(Related to the first brawl during Caleston: Redemption)
Human patron: I didn't take part in that brawl. I was sitting here with my drink.

Human patron: Take your guns somewhere else.

Human patron: I'm a paying customer. Leave me be.

(Related to the second brawl during Caleston: Redemption)
Human patron: It's been a while since I last saw Harrah around here. He didn't stop drinking, did he?

Human patron: I don't want any trouble.

Human patron: Go bother someone else.

Human patron: Ruushok says these are neutral grounds.

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Last Man Standing)
Human patron: I'm gonna get plastered. Now that the gangs are gone, we're gonna have a party.

Character present:

Unnamed human male or female worker

Human worker: You should be wearing a thermal suit. The people in administration might have a fit.

Human worker: Stay away from the vats! You don't want to fall into them.

Human worker: Watch out near the gravitic stills! They act up sometimes.

Human worker: If you ask me, the gangs can have this hellhole if they want it.

Human worker: Say, should you be in here?

Human worker: Sessa and Raciloma should stop messing around and just get it on. It would help them let out some steam.

(Male worker only)
Human worker: Stay away from the labs. Lots of aliens around, and they don't like people poking their noses.

(Female worker only)
Human worker: I heard a krogan tried to rough up Harrah. Better him than me, right?

(During the course of Caleston: Redemption)
Human worker: Harrah's been hanging around here recently. You think something's up?

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Last Man Standing)
Human worker: I'm looking forward to a good night's sleep.

Human worker: We'll be done soon with that new cruiser's drive core.

Human worker: It's been pretty rough on this station, but now things are looking up.

Human worker: The work still sucks, but at least we don't have to worry about getting shot anymore.

Human worker: Sessa left in a hurry.

Character present:

Unnamed human male or female worker

Human worker: Sorry, can't hear you! Too much noise!

Human worker: What are you doing without a thermal suit? You want to get your face cooked off?

Human worker: You can't just walk around here.

Human worker: If the Union sees me talking with an outsider, I could lose my job or worse.

Human worker: This job's dangerous enough without getting distracted.

Human worker: If you ask me, it's those damn aliens' fault. They arrived and moved straight to producing drugs.

(During the course of Caleston: Redemption)
Human worker: It's always either Harrah or you walking around.

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Last Man Standing)
Human worker: What happened to Sessa? She's usually here from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M.

Human worker: Things were pretty terrible. But then they sent someone to clean up the refinery.

Human worker: I'll be glad to finally have a day off this week end.

Human worker: Even without getting shot at, it's hard to take it easy.

Human worker: I could have sworn those clowns on the board back on Earth had forgotten about us.

Character present:

Unnamed salarian scientist

Salarian scientist: I don't want any trouble. I just do what I'm told.

Salarian scientist: You can't start a fight in here. There's several million credits' worth of eezo in this lab.

Salarian scientist: You shouldn't be here. This is very sensitive equipment.

Salarian scientist: It's difficult to do your work with so many thugs around.

Salarian scientist: If this eezo isn't 100% pure, then it has no value. I need to concentrate.

Salarian scientist: Please, try not to touch anything, you understand?

Salarian scientist: I wish the lab was closer to the elevators. Every day I go to work, I worry about getting shot.

Salarian scientist: Just what we were missing here. Another human waving guns around.

Salarian scientist: The refinery workers here are so... close-minded.

Salarian scientist: Can't even lunch at the Seventh Moon without some sweaty human sticking a gun under my nose.

(Related to the completion of Caleston: Last Man Standing)
Salarian scientist: It's a relief to see fewer guns around here. Oh, my bad.

Salarian scientist: I saw those red sand junkies on the news. Can't believe I had a part in it.
