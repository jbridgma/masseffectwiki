Henner is a businessman passing by the outskirts of Afterlife Club's lower levels in 2185. 







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




He talks to Commander Shepard after the Commander wakes up from being poisoned by the batarian bartender, Forvan. Amazed that Shepard survived, Henner relates his history with Forvan. Sometime before Shepard's visit, Henner and his friend Jake celebrated their new shipping business by buying drinks at Afterlife. After imbibing a drink poisoned by Forvan, Jake died an hour later. Henner states that no one is doing anything about Forvan because humans aren't held in high regard on Omega. 
Depending on what Shepard tells him, Henner either admonishes the Commander to be more careful or to give Forvan "what he deserves" before walking away chuckling.
