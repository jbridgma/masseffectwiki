Note:  originally, crewmates could be apparently talked to on Virmire in the salarian camp and would hold the same long conversations as on the Normandy. Even if these versions of the dialogues cannot be heard in the game, they should be technically functional. The transcriptions below are accurate. The rest of the dialogues have been omitted as they would play out the same as on the Normandy. Also note that several dialogue wheel options leading to the same Shepard voiceline is not an error, it's a common element throughout the first Mass Effect game.

Characters present:

Commander Shepard
Ashley Williams

(In this variant of the dialogue, only the "Renegade" answer is different; the rest has been omitted)
(...)
Shepard: Do you have a few minutes to talk, one-on-one?
Ashley Williams: Sure. I was just watching some mail from home.
Sarah Williams recording: Oh, before I go. We saw Kaidan in a news vid about the Normandy. He's cute. Later, sis.
Ashley Williams: Let's pretend this never happened.

(Par) Too late. (Neu) "Kaidan," hm? (Ren) This isn't the time for mail. (Inv) A relative?  Shepard: The damage is done, Williams.Ashley Williams: Oh, shoot me now. One of my sisters. That's Sarah. The youngest.(...) Shepard: Are you interested in the lieutenant, Chief?(...) Shepard: We're in the middle of enemy territory, Chief. Don't you have better things to do than view mail from home?
(If Ashley is being romanced) (If Ashley is not being romanced)  Ashley Williams: Uh, I should be inspecting my firearm. Sorry about that. It won't happen again.(End of conversation) Ashley Williams: Uh, I should be inspecting my firearm. It won't happen again. And, uh, I have no interest in the lieutenant.(...) Shepard: Your sister, I assume?Ashley Williams: Until I get home and kill her. That's Sarah. The youngest.(...)
(The following dialogue has a number of changes at the start and at the end if it were to happen on Virmire, and thus the middle part has been omitted here)

(If both Ashley and Liara are being romanced) (If Liara is not being romanced)  Ashley Williams: Surprised to see you here, sir. Thought you'd be chatting up what's-her-name. T'Soni.
(Par) Liara? (Neu) Why's that? (Ren) You're out of line.  Shepard: Liara? Why would you think that?Ashley Williams: Scuttlebutt says you've got a bit of thing for her. I could understand why. The crew's off-limits, with the regs against fraternization. And at least she looks like a woman.
(Par) That's cold. (Neu) Is that what you think? (Ren) You're out of line.  Shepard: You think I'm interested in Liara because she's the only one I'm allowed to date?Ashley Williams: So you are interested in her. 'Course, it could just be politics. Alien diplomat's daughter? Us under orders to make nice with the bug-eyed monsters? So what's up, Shepard? Don't know what I think about us attacking today, of all days. Kind of an ill omen. Shepard: You think I'm interested in Liara because she's the only one I'm allowed to date?Ashley Williams: So you are interested in her. 'Course, it could just be politics. Alien diplomat's daughter? Us under orders to make nice with the bug-eyed monsters? So what's up, Shepard? Don't know what I think about us attacking today, of all days. Kind of an ill omen. Shepard: I don't see how my personal life is any of your business, Chief.Ashley Williams: It's not. I just thought we were getting along pretty well. Sir.
(Par) Does that have to change? (Neu) And that was a problem. (Ren) I'm not interested in you.  Shepard: We are. I'd like that to continue.Ashley Williams: Hmm. All right. But I'm the jealous type, Commander. Just so you know. So what's up, Shepard? Don't know what I think about us attacking today, of all days. Kind of an ill omen. Shepard: Better than a commanding officer should with one of his crew.Ashley Williams: I read you, sir. I won't keep you any more. Have fun. Commander.(End of conversation) Shepard: I think I gave you the wrong impression.Ashley Williams: No worries, sir. Probably for the best anyway. The regs frown on fraternization. I won't keep you any more. Have fun. Commander.(End of conversation) Shepard: Liara? Why would you think that?Ashley Williams: Scuttlebutt says you've got a bit of thing for her. I could understand why. The crew's off-limits, with the regs against fraternization. And at least she looks like a woman.

Don't know what I think about us attacking today, of all days. Kind of an ill omen.
(Par) Armistice Day. (Neu) Why today? (Ren) Don't be superstitious.  Shepard: You mean on the anniversary of the First Contact War?Ashley Williams: The end of it, yeah. My family always marks it. I'm the only Williams here. I guess you'd be the only other one interested in it. Shepard: I don't understand. What's today?Ashley Williams: It's Armistice Day. When the First Contact War ended. My family always marks it. I'm the only Williams here. I guess you'd be the only other one interested in it. Shepard: Good thing I have my rabbit's foot. It should counteract all the negative waves.Ashley Williams: Just don't wave it around, skipper. Wrex might be hungry. It's Armistice Day. When the First Contact War ended. My family always marks it. I'm the only Williams here. I guess you'd be the only other one interested in it.
(...)
Ashley Williams: So now you know. Gonna kick me off the ship, skipper?

(Par) We need you. (Neu) Of course not. (Ren) You're valuable.  Shepard: You're a valuable part of my crew, Williams. If I want an opinion "from the head," I go to Alenko. When I want one "from the heart," I go to you.Ashley Williams: I also play a mean game of pool. I'm sure Kirrahe wants to brief you. I should get out of your hair.(...) Shepard: You're part of the team, Williams. I don't care what your grandfather did or didn't do.Ashley Williams: Not to get all cheesy, but you're the first C.O. who's ever said that to me. Thanks, skipper. I'm sure Kirrahe wants to brief you. I should get out of your hair.(...) Shepard: You're tough and decisive. I value those qualities.Ashley Williams: Just consider me a fire-and-forget missile. I'm sure Kirrahe wants to brief you. I should get out of your hair.(...)

Kaidan Alenko: Do you have some time to talk now, Commander?

(Par) Absolutely. (Neu) I'm listening. (Ren) Personal crap? Not interested.  Shepard: Of course. Pull up a tree stump.
(If the Zhu's Hope colony failed) (If the rachni queen was killed) (If neither happened)  Kaidan Alenko: I've been thinking about the Feros mission. How the colony ended up failing. You had to make some tough calls to get us this far. And it looks like there's going to be more. I'm just saying... try to leave yourself a way out. I've seen what cutting corners can do to someone. And I'd hate to have that happen to you, Shepard. Commander.(...) Kaidan Alenko: I've been thinking about the Noveria mission. About what we did to the rachni.

(If Shepard is female) (If Shepard is male)  Kaidan Alenko: Yes, ma'am. Just had some static on my comm. Got some signals wrong. Won't happen again.(End of conversation) Kaidan Alenko: I won't keep you, then. Commander.(End of conversation)
(...)
Kaidan Alenko: It's just my experience that once someone lets something slide, it tends to pick up speed. You get my meaning?

(Par) Bad experience? (Neu) You have an example. (Ren) No. Cut to the chase.  Shepard: Talk to me, Kaidan. You've got a little black raincloud sitting over your head.Kaidan Alenko: Oh, I'm sure it's just the humidity. You know the records about the biotic training out on Jump Zero? They're all classified. Because the Alliance made mistakes. After first contact, Conatix was set up to track element zero exposures and develop implants for humans. Once we had an embassy on the Citadel, Conatix could bring in "experts" instead of taking it slow. Shepard: You're talking about a particular example, aren't you?Kaidan Alenko: You know the records about the biotic training out on Jump Zero? They're all classified.

Once we had an embassy on the Citadel, Conatix could bring in "experts" instead of taking it slow. Shepard: Alenko, if you have one failure, it's an inability to speak directly.Kaidan Alenko: Sorry. I'm not looking to dump any baggage, Shepard. You know the records about the biotic training out on Jump Zero? They're all classified. Because the Alliance made mistakes.

Ashley Williams: If they don't court-martial you. You endangered the entire mission. Why didn't you just leave one of us behind?

(Par) You wouldn't have. (Neu) Not an option. (Ren) I knew what I was doing.  Shepard: Say what you want, Williams. If you were calling the shots, you'd have done the same. Alenko would've, too.Kaidan Alenko: We might have tried, Commander. But I don't think either one of us could have pulled this off. Shepard: No one gets left behind.

Ashley Williams: Kaidan's right. Nobody else could make a stunt like that work. Put anyone else in charge and someone gets left behind. Or the mission fails.

(Neu) Saren's still out there. (Ren) We can't fail!  Shepard: This mission isn't over yet. We still have to find the Conduit before Saren does. Shepard: I won't accept failure. This mission is too important. Saren's still looking for the Conduit. But we're going to find it first!

Kirrahe: Rest assured, Commander, my men and I will not forget what you have accomplished here. We will leave your ship as soon as you reach your next destination. Perhaps we will have the opportunity to work together again some day.

Ashley Williams

Ashley Williams: I hope we can get the Council to give us a hand, skipper. I'd hate to think we nuked a perfectly nice world for nothing.

(Par) I hope so. (Neu) We can convince them. (Ren) They think I'm nuts.  Shepard: They're right, you know. We don't have much proof. My "visions" and the word of a rebellious Spectre. Shepard: Once they know the truth about Sovereign, they'll get involved. Shepard: They've dismissed all my concerns out of hand. "Visions." May as well have told them I divined it from entrails.
(The rest of the dialogue proceeds as normal)
