Description[]
Sobek is a hydrogen-nitrogen gas giant believed to be an extrasolar capture. Its low-G moons were the sites of many batarian labor camps during the Anhur Rebellions, generating raw materials for the war. When the slaves were finally liberated by Eclipse the mercenaries found abysmal conditions, including whole camps that lacked mass effect fields to keep the gravity at habitable levels. The widespread bone loss among the slaves was part of their masters' final degradation — it would cripple them if they ever left for a standard-gravity world.
The plight of the slaves soon garnered galactic media attention, and several charities sprang up to pay for their physical therapy and find them gainful employment. Eclipse mercenaries, normally reviled for their cutthroat tactics and criminal employees, found themselves painted as heroes. The mercenary company still retains an office on Sobek's moon Heqet, out of nostalgia as much as a business strategy.
