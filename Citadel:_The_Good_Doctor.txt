The following information is drawn from cut content and is not to be considered canon in any way.

Citadel: The Good Doctor is an assignment in Mass Effect which was cut during development. It would have involved delivering supplies to a doctor on the Citadel.[1]

Plotline[]
Once this assignment started, the player would be able to acquire supplies and then deliver them. The supplies would come in two categories: "regular" and "advanced". Additionally, a discount could be negotiated. No apparent endpoint to this assignment is provided, but whether this means the quest was repeatable is not clear.
