Player Notes[]
Mechanics
The force rating behind Lash is significant, and it scales along with increases to its raw power damage. Unshielded, unarmored enemies such as husks who are hit at the correct angle (usually by aiming the reticule as far away as possible from the target while still targeting them) can be sent flying.
When targeting above the enemy, this may literally launch the enemy out of many multiplayer maps, resulting in an instant kill.
When targeting at other angles, significant physics-based damage can still be done, many times exceeding the actual damage of the power; this includes damage from large falls, multiple collisions with other objects, or even just one collision at high speed.
Lash can strike with force sufficient to stagger the sternest opponents like Banshees and Scions. This can enable it to save allies from sync kills.
Phantoms are resistant to the effects of Lash due to their ability to quickly recover and stabilize themselves before impact with the rockets built into their armor, but if power recharge times are short enough, Lash can simply be cast repeatedly to keep them off their feet.
Lashing on Geth Hunters will NOT force them to de-cloak, but the Damage Over Time evolution can help to reveal any invisible target.
The direct damage dealt by Lash is dealt before the force effect. Thus, if the damage destroys a target's shields or barriers, it will fling the target with full force, rather than none (or partial force with the Shield Penetration evolution).
Lash can be used to pull away a Guardian's shields. However, unlike Pull, Lash cannot remove a CAT6 Heavy's shield, and will instead only displace it for a split-second.
In single-player, Lash detonates any target primed for Power Combos; in multiplayer, Lash cannot detonate armored targets.
Compared to other powers, Lash's casting animation is very long, potentially subjecting the user to very large amounts of return fire. To make matters worse, dodging before the projectile impacts its target will immediately cancel it.
Lash, when evolved with the Rank 6 Shield Penetration evolution, pulls most infantry enemies and primes them for a Biotic Explosion. In single-player, this even includes Kai Leng.
Strategies
With light weapons and a fast recharge, a skilled Project Phoenix Adept or Project Phoenix Vanguard can quickly Lash an opponent and then rapidly use Smash on them, detonating the effect and causing massive damage.
Care should be taken when attempting to Lash Abominations and especially Possessed Abominations. Angling away the Lash projectile to throw them sideways is the only safe method. Lashing these enemies and pulling them towards yourself or the squad just causes them to violently explode right at your feet.
Even though its cooldown is usually on the shorter side, the long cast animation makes it important for every cast of Lash to land. Techniques that prevent enemies from dodging the projectile such as by stunning them with other weapons or powers are useful.
