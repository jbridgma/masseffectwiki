Vetus is a system of five worlds, of which four are terrestrials and one is a gas giant. Its asteroid belt is named the Klein Belt. It is majorly settled and developed by humans with some minor but competitive alien presence.
The system's main economic draw is Elysium, as it's situated along favorable trade routes. Joppa is fiercely contested ground for helium-3 mining rights for this reason, though the other worlds are barely developed for resource extraction.
