Arinlarkan is a small system with a single barely-habitable planet and an asteroid belt orbiting far too close to its star. It is considered an out-of-the-way backwater, mostly traveled by people fleeing from something and hoping to make it to the cluster's mass relay. Its sole untamed planet is rich in resources particularly platinum.
