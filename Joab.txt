Description[]
Joab is a two-mooned habitable planet that is most well known for its mass extinction event. Thousands of years ago, Joab was home to a primate-like spacefaring civilization as well as abundant flora and fauna. However, this can only be deduced from time capsules put into the ground well outside habitation centers -- all cities and detectable dwellings were targeted in a massive orbital bombardment that turned them into vapor. The resulting dust shroud killed all photosynthetic life and all fauna dependent on it.
Today, humans have recolonized the planet and are rapidly introducing their own species, beginning with cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria to bring a suitable level of oxygen and nitrogen for respiration.
TRAVEL ADVISORY: Atmospheric pressure at sea level on Joab is double that of Earth. Visitors with upper respiratory infections, emphesyma [sic], cancer or a history of thoracic surgery should consult their physician before landing on Joab.

Trivia[]
Joab is named after a person of the same name in the Judaic Torah or the Old Testament.
Joab's capital city, New Jericho, is probably named after the city Jericho, located in eastern Palestine. In the bible, Jericho was the location of the first battle of the Israelites in their conquest of Canaan.
