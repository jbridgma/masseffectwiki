Description[]
A lonely world of rock and ice, Nalisin clings to the outer rim of the Satu Arrd system.  Its freezing temperatures and carbon-dioxide atmosphere were braved by eezo smugglers, who set up camps in the tunnels honeycombing the southern hemisphere's mountain ranges.  The camps were abandoned when turian patrols began regular raids on the smugglers' cave systems.
