Citadel: Save My Sister is an assignment in Mass Effect which was cut during development. It would have taken place on the Citadel, and would have had Commander Shepard try to re-unite two sisters who were working separately.[1]

Plotline[]
This assignment would have revolved around three characters: Ari, Rita and "SW". First you would have Ari tell her story at Flux, and then hear SW's "conditions." For the latter, you could do some "fact-finding" (the outcomes of which are summarized as either "not sure", "long-term" or "arbitrary decision"). Going to see Rita, she could then be persuaded in several ways, notably to "give out drinks" or simply "persuaded to pay." In parallel, you could also go back to Ari to persuade her to apologize. The assignment could end in two ways: either Rita is "fired", or Ari is "re-hired."

Trivia[]
This cut assignment bears more than a passing resemblance to Citadel: Rita's Sister.
