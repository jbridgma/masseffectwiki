Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Auxiliary Systems will only work while using Tech Skills.
Rank 4 Weapon Mass Reduction adds 40 points of Weight Capacity, rather than %.
Strategies
Rank 6 Shield Feedback synergizes very well with Team Support's Rank 6 Life Support by allowing Ryder to periodically restore both Shields and Health simultaneously when using any Tech power.
