Berserker Armor is a variant of krogan heavy armor, produced by Geth Armory for Saren Arterius' krogan forces. Shepard can procure the armory license for Geth Armory from Morlan, the salarian merchant in the Wards' market district.
Berserker Armor has the highest tech/biotic protection of all armors attainable without console commands. It has identical stats and a similar appearance to Geth Armory's other armors, Battlemaster and Rage Armor, which also boast higher-than-average stats overall thanks to the geth materials used in their construction.[1]
