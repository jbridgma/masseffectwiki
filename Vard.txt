Description[]
Vard is a methane-ammonia ice giant. Until the Krogan Rebellions, it had a sizable helium-3 fuel refining infrastructure. Once the solar arrays orbiting Nith were destroyed, the constant flow of antiproton tankers visiting the system disappeared. There was little point to maintaining the facilities, so they were shut down and abandoned. Today the ancient stations are "squatted" by transients, criminals, and outcasts. Although few are safe for habitation, neither the krogan nor the Council Demilitarization Enforcement Mission (CDEM) patrols care if they take their chances.
