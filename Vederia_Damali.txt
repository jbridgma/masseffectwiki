Vederia Damali is an asari commando who joined the Andromeda Initiative and serves under Sarissa Theris and Pathfinder Matriarch Ishara.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




After Matriarch Ishara is killed by kett and Sarissa Theris is promoted to Pathfinder, Vederia becomes Sarissa's second and next in line for the position, although her training is incomplete and she has little combat experience. When Pathfinder Ryder locates Ark Leusinia, Vederia helps them find the cause of the Ark's power drainage and defeat the kett boarders.
When Ryder discovers that Sarissa lied about Ishara's death, Ryder can choose to expose Sarissa and make Vederia the new asari Pathfinder. If she is promoted, Cora Harper mentors Vederia to help prepare her for the role. Should Ryder inquire about Vederia's goals now that she became a Pathfinder, Vederia will inform Ryder that she intends to explore and chart the Scourge, and also use that information to drive the kett from their boltholes.
If made Pathfinder, Vederia will participate in the battle for Meridian and can be seen shielding Initiative shuttles with her biotics. If Ryder has the support of all three non-human Pathfinders, Vederia summons a biotic shield to protect the bridge of the crashing Ark Hyperion during the battle in the Meridian sphere, saving the life of Captain Nozomi Dunn.
