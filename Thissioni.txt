Description[]
Thissioni's surface is a desert of lime streaked with sodium banks. The only real features of note are empty calderas scattered around the fault lines, suggesting Thissioni was once more geologically active. While average temperatures are near-habitable, Thissioni has not retained a protective atmosphere and is thus a third-tier world unlikely to be terraformed.
