See also: Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer/Weekend Challenges
Challenges are a cooperative multiplayer gameplay mechanic introduced in Mass Effect 3: Retaliation. Completing certain goals will complete a Challenge, providing the player with Challenge Points, which serve as measure of their experience. There are two types of Challenges:  Silver Challenges involve meeting a certain statistical requirement in order to be considered completed;  Gold Challenges can be completed by fulfilling enough of the Silver Challenges they cover. Completing a Gold Challenge unlocks a banner and title card to display in the match lobby. All Challenges (except "Mass Effect," "Squad Elite," and the Silver Challenges they contain and temporary Challenges) can be completed multiple times.[1]
Once a repeatable Gold Challenge is completed, all completed Silver Challenges they cover are reset, allowing them to be completed again. Progress in unfinished Silver Challenges in the set are retained.
Note:  All three Silver Challenges for Biotic Explosions Detonated 1, 2, & 3 or Tech Explosions Detonated 1, 2, & 3 (for Biotic Mastery or Tech Mastery) must be completed in a single Gold Challenge completion or they stay marked as completed and do not reset correctly. 

Each Silver Detonation Challenge will continue to show asÂ % (percentage) complete on the Gold Challenge but will not show as complete on the (X) of (Y) complete challenge scoring. It is possible for the player to have over 100% complete showing and still not have enough Silver Challenges to complete the Gold Challenge.
Both Biotic Mastery and Tech Mastery still have enough Silver Challenges (besides the Silver Challenges in question) to be able to complete the Gold Challenge. The player will need to complete up to two Silver Challenges above and beyond the normal amount required.
If the player runs into this problem, the player must complete the remaining Silver Detonation Challenges and attain the remaining needed Silver Challenges to again acquire the Gold Challenge. Biotic Explosions Detonated 1, 2, & 3 or Tech Explosions Detonated 1, 2, & 3 will then reset back to normal.
Any partially completed Silver Detonation Challenges will still be available for completion after acquiring the Gold Challenge for a subsequent Gold Challenge.
The player should either complete all three Silver Challenges, keep Detonation 1 partially completed for the entire Gold Challenge, or plan to complete extra Silver Challenges for a subsequent Gold Challenge (if a portion of the Silver Detonation Challenges are completed but not all).
Progress generally counts towards all relevant Challenges at the same time. For instance, promoting a character counts towards all of the N7 Mastery Challenges. When medals are concerned, each level of the medal counts separately (for example, a Silver First Aid Medal counts as two for the Squad Elite First Aid Medal Challenge since you also earned the Bronze level).
BioWare chose alternate banners from entries in a community contest held February 15 - 22, 2013.[2][3] The alternate banners can be selected for in-lobby display via the online N7 HQ.
