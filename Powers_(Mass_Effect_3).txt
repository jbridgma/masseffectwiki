This article is about abilities in Mass Effect 3. For abilities in the original Mass Effect, see Talents. For abilities in Mass Effect 2, see Powers. For an alphabetized list of all Powers across both games, see Category:Powers. For abilities in Mass Effect: Andromeda, see Skills.

The abilities used in combat in both single-player and multiplayer Mass Effect 3 are called powers. This article emphasizes single-player mode; more on the various classes and their available powers in multiplayer mode can be found on the Character Customization page. The individual pages for specific powers also have information on single-player versus multiplayer variations of each power where applicable.

Mechanics[]
Each power used by the player or a member of the squad (with the exception of First Aid) follows the same general pattern as Powers from Mass Effect 2, but now two additional ranks are possible up to a maximum rank of 6. As with Mass Effect 2's rank 4, Mass Effect 3's ranks 4-6 give two power choices with the sixth always being passive. Ammo powers also return in Mass Effect 3 though with some differences from how they worked in the previous game; for more information see the Weapons page. 
As in the previous game, most powers in Mass Effect 3 automatically lock on to enemies and either hit home instantly or fire seeking projectiles some of which are capable of arcing around cover. In Mass Effect 3, many power projectiles are noticeably faster with faster possible recharge times compared to in the previous game, though on the downside many enemy types are now capable of dodging powers. As in Mass Effect 2, powers utilized by squadmates almost never fire actual projectiles and instead impact targets instantly and thus can't be evaded by enemies the vast majority of the time. Also like in Mass Effect 2, biotic or other powers that can lift or knock enemies around only work fully against enemies unprotected by barriers, shields, or armor, however there are more powers in Mass Effect 3 that are capable of affecting enemies still with some protection.  
Shepard's powers and bonus power, plus the powers of all of the major squadmates with the exception of Javik, can be reassigned at two terminals located in the medical bay of the Normandy SR-2. Reassigning powers resets every skill point to be unassigned for Shepard or the desired squadmate. You can immediately reallocate Shepard's points from the Squad screen, but you won't be able to reallocate squadmate points until you take that squadmate on a mission or into a combat situation. The first reassignment is free, but if repeated the cost increases by 5,000 credits with each purchase, up to a maximum of 25,000 credits per reassignment for that individual. Reassigning Shepard's bonus power always costs 5,000 credits, with the pool of available powers expanding by earning achievements mostly relating to the squadmate the power belongs to (see below).

Commander Shepard[]
Shepard can earn up to 181 points to allocate to powers. A new game starts Shepard at level 1 with 3 predetermined points. The following table shows the amount of points earned per level with the total amount at level 60. Levels that are grouped reward the same amount of points per level, with the total amount awarded for that series of levels shown in the far right column.




Level(s)
Points Per Level
Total


1
3
3


2 - 30
2
58


31 - 60
4
120


Total
-
181



This gives you the option of fully maxing out 8 powers with 13 points remaining at level 60, enough to bring one other power up to level 4 with 3 points remaining unspent, though of course other combinations are entirely possible.

Imported ME2 Saves[]
Depending on Shepard's level in a completed save you can have up to 51 points to carry over to ME3. However, imported saves of levels 26 - 30 will give two additional points per level totaling up to 61 points.
With one exception you can decide how your points are allocated before importing ME2 saves. For an easier explanation, let's assume you have a level 30 Shepard.

Any class ranks you had in ME2 will be given in ME3 (e.g. Rank 3 Warp).
You will start with 61 points between spent and unspent points (55 unspent + 6 spent in Rank 3 Warp).
Any points in a Loyal Power (e.g. Miranda's Slam) will be given back as unspent points.
If you wish to start ME3 with all 61 points unspent, import a save that has 51 unspent points or choose a different class than your ME2 import during character customization. You may also reset your points in the med bay once aboard the Normandy. This is useful if you use the same class in ME3 as your imported ME2 Shepard, but want to reallocate points.
Base Powers[]
Each player class has access to First Aid, a power that uses medi-gel to revive fallen squadmates and restore a portion of Shepard's health; Fitness, to increase health, shields and melee damage; a passive class power, to increase reputation and other class-specific bonuses; and 6 active powers.
The following is a list of powers available to each class. Powers available from the very beginning are marked with a ✓, while powers that need to be unlocked by leveling up are marked with a •.

Bonus Powers[]
Each player class is able to learn one additional bonus power. These are unlocked through conversations with your squad or through completion of DLC missions (most of which are included in Legendary Edition). Each squad member can unlock two bonus powers. Since Ashley Williams and Kaidan Alenko both can't be present in one playthrough, to unlock both powers from each of them requires playing at least one game of Mass Effect 3 with each of them being the Virmire Survivor to unlock their bonus powers (unless PC Tweaks or save editors are used). Fortunately, it isn't necessary to play through an entire game to unlock the bonus powers, it's only necessary to play until the required event in the story that unlocks them (see below). As in Mass Effect 2, once a bonus power has been unlocked it becomes available for all future characters and games of Mass Effect 3, and one of the available bonus powers must be picked during the character creation process. Any unlocked power can be chosen with the exception of Dominate.
