Appearances
Mass Effect (cut)


Ruushok is a character in Mass Effect who was cut during the game's development. He was intended to be the krogan bartender of The Seventh Moon on Throw Down station on Caleston.
Ruushok has a very bad temper and won't tolerate chit-chat, even from Shepard. He often taunts and insults his customers whenever he has a chance, but appreciates it when someone goes straight to the point. He serves drinks like alcohol, including whiskey (which he regularly sells to security chief Jason Harrah), and some food such as buffalo wings (which he may serve to Urdnot Wrex if he is present).[1]
