Dholen is turning into a red giant. As the star matures, the system experiences magnetic eruptions and increased solar output. This is a gateway system, although it has no fuel depot. 
Because this is a geth-controlled system, all civilian traffic is prohibited. Resource estimates are moderate to rich.







“The chances of surviving are… slim.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 2 follow.




Prior to the boarding operation aboard the Alarei, Kal'Reegar (if he survived the assault on Haestrom) informs Shepard and Tali that quarian scientists are worried about dark energy destabilizing Dholen and causing it to mature into a red giant too rapidly by reducing the mass of its interior. Though there is a consensus that the geth were not responsible for the anomaly, it is left unclear as to whether this phenomenon is natural or artificial.
