Prerequisite: Priority: Geth Dreadnought (Mass Effect 3)

Argos Rho is located relatively close to Gemini Sigma. However, the mass relay route requires passing through three other clusters first, the total distance covered far greater than a straight-line measurement.
The cluster is generally ignored by most galactic powers, possibly due to the fact that the vast majority of the planets are uninhabitable and thus nonviable for colony establishment. This obscurity means that a wide variety of factions, from pirates to Cerberus, to even the geth, have been able to operate out of the cluster largely unhindered.
