Description[]
A dwarf planet, Choitadix is notable for gold deposited by an asteroid strike that, geologically speaking, happened fairly recently. Surveyors suspected Choitadix was once larger but was reduced in size by the strike, which knocked enough material out of the planet to create misshapen moonlets. Its name, which means "gap-toothed" in a common turian language, was retroactively added once scientists confirmed this hypothesis.
It appears the pulverized orbital stations here were abandoned as a preemptive move before the Reapers reached the cluster. The fate of the refugees is unknown. If they fled to Triginta Petra, the outlook is particularly poor.
