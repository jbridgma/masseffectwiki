Description[]
Lusarn's heat pummels the Nirana Belt, a ring of protoplanetary material relatively close to the star. However, this heat is not enough to instigate true melting as occurs in a planet's formation, so carbonaceous asteroids such as Beyalt retain a primitive makeup. Beyalt has yet to be exploited, so the Reapers appear to have ignored it. Probes suggest it is high in chondrites and troilite.
