Surveillance Transcript[]
Surveillance Transcript
Medical Clinic, Omega
Patient: I can't... I can't... (unintelligible)...
Dr. Mordin Solus: Call.
Dr. Daniel Abrams: Damn it!
MS: Time of death, 22:17. Need to remove body, sanitize area. Not that sanitation matters. Same plague. Still, no need to risk further infection.
DA: How can you... shouldn't we do something for him?
MS: Why? Batarian belief in afterlife involves soul leaving body through eyes. Treatment of corpse unimportant by cultural standards. Unless eyes removed by enemies. (sniff) Very insulting.
DA: But we just lost another patient!
MS: Yes. More patients than time. Impossible to save everyone. Go crazy if you try. So save who you can, move on. Save more if we hurry.
DA: We shouldn't be in here waiting for people to come to us! We should be out there getting medicine to them! I can go!
MS: No. Pointless. Already more than enough patients here! Can't risk combat with vorcha or gangs. Better to save those who make effort to come to us.
Assistant: Doctor, there are Blue Suns outside. They're... they're asking for all the humans to come out.
MS: Of course. Expected as much. Losing to vorcha. Need to establish dominance. Will speak with them. Daniel, remove corpse, get next patient. Still more to save.
(Sound of footsteps, Solus leaves.)
Assistant: He's not going to turn us over to them, is he?
DA: I don't think so. Listen, when he gets back... tell him I took some of the cure. I'm going to go out and help.
Assistant: But...
DA: Just tell him!
(Sound of footsteps, Abrams leaves.)
Assistant: You can't... my god! (sound of gunfire) What's going on?
(Sound of footsteps, Solus returns.)
MS: Get up. Danger has pastÂ [sic]. Blue Suns didn't expect resistance. Foolish of them. Won't make that mistake again. No chance to, I suppose. Please, up! Need you to bring in next patient. Wait. Medical supplies missing. Corpse not removed. Where is Daniel?
Assistant: He said...
MS: Went into slums? Trying to help those too sick to come in?
Assistant: ...Yes.
MS: (sniff) His decision. Hope he lives. Can't help him now. Too busy... Bring next patient.
