Description[]
The Scattershot fires particle blasts which can focus upon a target at range. This focusing effect is a result of advanced Initiative targeting systems and invisible "tracing" of paths for the Remnant-derived energy beams. The Scattershot does not require reloading, but will overheat from continuous use. 

Features[]
The Scattershot is a unique oddball among its contemporaries. Its damage output is average at best, but its pellets not only ricochet off of hard surfaces, they actively seek out targets in the rough vicinity of its crosshairs. It is therefore virtually impossible to miss with the Scattershot as long as the target is in range and the player was aiming in its general direction when the trigger was pulled. However, this comes at the cost of extremely short range even for a shotgun.
Being a Remnant-derived weapon, the Scattershot is subject to all the advantages and drawbacks of this weapon family. 
Its internal heat sink gives it infinite spare ammunition, but its fairly low damage and average clip size means that it will overheat quickly if the player fails to keep an eye on their ammo count. Installing a Shotgun Barrel mod does little to change this because even tier X mods only provide a ~20% damage boost, and there are no mods available to increase shotgun clip size.
The Scattershot is completely useless beyond extremely short range (~6 meters) because its projectiles simply dissipate past its effective range. Therefore the gun either deals full damage to the target, or none at all if it is even an inch too far away.
Like all Remnant weapons, the Scattershot can only be acquired by crafting it at a Research Station. It will never appear as random loot or in APEX loot containers.
The Scattershot is unable to use a Shotgun Clip Mod because these only increase spare ammo, of which the Scattershot already has an infinite amount.
The shotgun's damage has been improved twice in post-launch updates.

Strategies[]
SingleplayerMultiplayer
Singleplayer
Unlike other shotgun models with extremely short range, the Scattershot is sorely lacking in hitting power. Since even basic infantry can survive several Scattershot hits, this makes the tactic of closing in for a devastating one-hit killshot impossible to pull off against anything but harmless insectoid critters, which essentially railroads the Scattershot into a very small niche on the battlefield: close quarters combat from cover. While a lot of firefights do indeed happen at fairly short distances, the Scattershot's range is so short that even there it rarely gets a chance to contribute anything useful to the squad's damage output. The weapon is therefore generally fun to use but of little actual value in the field under most circumstances.
There are only four Mods for shotguns. The Scattershot can't use a Shotgun Clip Mod, so there is no point in adding a Double Mod Extension augmentation to the Scattershot to add 2 extra mods slots.
