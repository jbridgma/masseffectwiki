Player Notes[]
Havoc Strike is basically a non-biotic version of Charge in that it sends the player flying towards the target, causing massive damage and knockback. Unlike Charge, however, you will not replenish any shields upon a successful strike. This is a high risk, high reward power.
When you trigger Havoc Strike your character becomes invincible until the power ends. It can be used when you are in a critical situation to stagger enemies and then quickly back away with your propulsors to replenish your health/shields, either by taking cover or using a Stimulant Pack.
When Havoc Strike is triggered, your character does not charge right away. Instead, he hovers briefly, during which time you can slightly adjust the trajectory of the strike. This facilitates maneuvers that require more finesse, such as knocking an enemy out of the map's boundaries.
While not mentioned in the power description, the Rank 6 Force and Damage evolution's increase of 55% force is visible in the stat bars.
Havoc Strike's initial hover and follow-up propulsor dodges can avoid enemy melee attacks or sync kills. Coupled with the invincibility during the charge, this makes Havoc Strike one of the best options for tanking a high-threat enemy at close range such as a lunging Brute. Even though the player character may appear to get staggered by certain enemy attacks, as long as the initial hover of the strike was not interrupted, the charge will still complete.
Havoc Strike can be triggered while utilizing jump jets in any direction as long as an enemy can be targeted.
It's possible to use a heavy melee attack right after starting a Havoc Strike (while hovering). If the Havoc Strike target is within melee range, this will result in both a Havoc Strike hit and a heavy melee landing in quick succession on the target.
