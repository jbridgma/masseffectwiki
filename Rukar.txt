Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Freedom's Progress (mission)

Anytime after gaining access to the Citadel, walking past two krogan (Kargesh and Rukar) on Level 27 and overhearing their discussion will activate the assignment.

Walkthrough[]

You are required to ask around for any people who might be knowledgeable on the matter before you can provide answers for the krogan pair. Direct Commander Shepard to go upstairs to the Dark Star Lounge on Level 28. A turian Presidium Groundskeeper can be found on the right side of the club. Talk to him and ask if there are fish in the lakes. He will explain that the lakes are reservoirs that provide water for the Presidium. The only place that he knows where to find fish on the Citadel is the Citadel Souvenirs store.
When you return to Kargesh and Rukar, you can quell Kargesh's expectations by revealing there are no fish and you'll gain 5 Paragon points. Alternatively, you can prank them a bit. Before speaking with them, go to the nearby Citadel Souvenirs store, buy any of the fish, and then sell one of them to Kargesh, claiming it came from the Presidium, much to the krogan's delight. You earn 5 Renegade points for the lie. Note:  You don't actually lose any of the fish you purchased, they will still show up on your aquarium on the Normandy.

Trivia[]
In Mass Effect, talking to Wrex on the Presidium may sometimes prompt him to say, "I could use a snack. Think there's any fish out in that lake?"
The krogan briefly mention that an Urdnot was allowed in the Council Chambers once, a reference to the time that Wrex was Shepard's squadmate in Mass Effect, and spoke with the Council.
