To: Shadow Broker
From: Tali'Zorah nar Rayya
I know you don't know me. I'm the daughter of Admiral Rael'Zorah, and I've run into trouble on my Pilgrimage. I was investigating a disabled geth and found a recording that seems to indicate that a Spectre named Saren is working with the geth. He's betrayed the Council and is working for some group called the Reapers.
I'm on the Citadel now, but Saren's people are after me. This is too big for me to deal with. I'm willing to offer you the information in exchange for protection. Are you interested?
To: Tali'Zorah nar Rayya
From: Shadow Broker
I'm interested, and you were smart to come to me. I have an enforcer on the Citadel named Fist. He can protect you. Give him the information and let him get you someplace safe.
To: Shadow Broker
From: Tali'Zorah nar Rayya
No deal. Saren has turned too many people against me. If we're doing this, I want to meet you in person. I can't trust anybody else.
To: Tali'Zorah nar Rayya
From: Shadow Broker:
Understood. I'll meet you in person. Fist will set it up.
To: Fist
From: Shadow Broker
I'm forwarding you the intel on a quarian named Tali'Zorah. She wants a meeting, and she's got valuable intel. Get her someplace safe, and avoid any intelligence channels. Spectre Saren Arterius is after her.
When you get the intel, kill the quarian and any of our operatives who had access to the data. This information cannot be compromised. Top-level security. You'll be compensated for the loss of any of your people.
To: Shadow Broker
From: Tali'Zorah nar Rayya
Your agent was compromised. He tried to sell me out to Saren. I've turned the information over to a human Alliance commander named Shepard, and I think I've got all the protection I need. Thank you for your offer, and I hope this does not affect any future exchanges.
To: Tali'Zorah nar Rayya
From: Shadow Broker
Of course. I apologize for Fist's behavior. Should you ever change your mind, I'd be more than happy to offer my personal protection. Please contact me at your earliest convenience.
