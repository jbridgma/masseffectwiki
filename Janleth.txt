Mass Effect: Andromeda


Janleth is one of the scientists working on Hjara Station's ice samples. Compared to her colleague Deenor, she is more skeptical and prefers grounded explanations over fantastical theories. They were both university-educated in Voeld's capital Estraaja.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




When Deenor puts forth a theory that "ice talkers" are responsible for the variance in microbe samples from their ice block, Janleth scoffs and jokingly warns him he's fired if he mentions the old college joke one more time. More seriously, she thinks Deenor discovered something mundane caused by industrial emissions, weapons tests, or somebody who crashed a vehicle into the sea. Deenor's numbers aren't enough to suggest anything extraordinary about their sample, that he's reaching and trying to fit the data to his conclusions, and that it won't hold up to university scrutiny.
Pathfinder Ryder can overhear their argument and ask both their perspectives on the matter. Janleth is willing to provide details on their field of study, but leaves explaining the "ice talkers" bit to Deenor. She's also familiar with yevara, and can direct the Pathfinder to a nearby yevara-watching station for further information.
