Walkthrough[]
Go with Liam to Prodromos[]
Once you're on Eos, interact with a navpoint  for "Liam's Surprise" to start a cutscene.
It turns out that Liam has set up a game of soccer (football) for the crew. Pathfinder Ryder and Liam talk about Liam's past in the refugee camps.
You can inquire about why this wasn't made to be a bigger deal and Liam will respond that this is just for the crew. Ryder then joins the game.
If you have flirted enough with Liam before, there will be different dialog and an opportunity to commit to his romance path.
The mission ends after the conversation.
