[AMBIENT CUTSCENE]: A geth dropship buzzes the gatehouse and ocntinues [sic] further down the canyon.







[AMBIENT CUTSCENE]: A geth dropship buzzes overhead, firing rockets which miss Shepard. It then drops geth into cover in front of Shepard, and continues to drop more squads to replace losses.







CUTSCENE: Liara runs into the tower, pursued by mercs. One is about to fire at her, but another stops him and warns they have to take Liara alive. Liara escapes into the tower and activates the shields/defenses, trapping herself inside. The mercs then notice the player.







Mercenary Leader: "Heads up, they're trying to flank!"







CONVERSATION: Liara talks to the player and unlocks the door to the dig stie. [sic]

Caleston[]



GanglandAdministrator Tombiri told you that Liara is being held by Smiley, a local salarian drug lord. Unfortunately, Smiley is quite paranoid, and is sealed inside the station's former medical bay.

[2]





GanglandYou've learned Liara's current location from the criminals on Throw Down.

[3]





Confront SmileyYour team and Sessa Tarrent have killed Raciloma. You now have a pass into Smiley's heavily guarded sanctum. Head to the former medical bay in Throw Down Plaza.

[4]





TurnaboutYou've been deceived; Smiley never had Liara. Administrator Tombiri has secretly been running the Miners' Union. She lied to get you to eliminate Smiley for her. It's time to pay a little visit to the Administration Office.

[5]





Talk to SessaAdministrator Tombiri suggested you work with Sessa Tarrent to get at Smiley. Sessa works for the Miners' Union, an organization which appears to have its fingers in a number of unsavory pies. She can be found in the Refinery level.

[6]





Reporting InSessa Tarrent asked you to help her team destroy a cache of Cartel drugs. They are at a test bore site outside the mining station; exit through the garage below Throw Down Plaza.

[7]





Reporting InThe test bore site, and the Cartel's drug cache, have been destroyed. Report back to Sessa Tarrent in the refinery.

[8]





AmbushYour destruction of the drug cache has drawn out Raciloma, the younger brother of Smiley. He will meet to negotiate with Sessa in the shut-down southern line of the refinery. Your team will precede them to the meeting site, and prepare an ambush to kill Raciloma.

Cerberus BrainchildThe co-ordinates from the ship's captain have led you to this planet. It's possible the krogan cyborg you fought on the ship came from this planet.

[11]



Cerberus BrainchildYou've linked up with an Alliance Spy. Though she's concerned about the krogan cyborgs, she believes that's the least of your worries. If she's correct, Cerberus is hiding an AI on a planet somewhere in this system.

[12]



Cerberus BrainchildCerberus was using an AI to create the krogan cyborgs, but you destroyed the AI at it's [sic] own request. Chiara Rossi has promised to relay the information you uncovered to the Alliance.

Codex[]
Aliens: Non-Sapient Creatures: Harvesters[]





Audio: Harvestershttps://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/File:Codex_Harvester_ME1.wav


“Harvesters are gigantic insects, easily distinguished by their long necks and incredible size. The origin of these creatures is a mystery, though recently they have begun to appear unexpectedly on multiple uncharted worlds in the Attican Traverse.

Some have suggested they have been in hibernation, and like locusts have emerged after a long period of inactivity. Others point out that the bizarre morphology of harvesters runs counter to known laws of adaptive evolution. Their forward-loaded body and undersized wings suggest they were a product of illegal genetic engineering. 

Regardless of their origin, harvesters are fast, efficient killers. They attack anything that enters their territory with toxic venom and razor-sharp claws. Despite their ungainly appearance, their exoskeletons can only be penetrated by heavy weapons. Attacking them while in a vehicle is dangerous, attacking them on foot is suicidal.”

[23]


Weapons, Armor and Equipment: Grenades[]

“Grenades are hand-tossed explosive charges, useful against organic and synthetic targets. The Alliance's standard Mark 14 grenade is designed with retractable stabilizing fins. If the fins are extended, the grenade can be tossed like a discus, and glides long distances. With the fins retracted, the grenade can be lobbed over walls and other obstacles. Most grenades have a 10-second fuse. They can be triggered earlier by a signal from any military hardsuit's built-in communications gear.

The Mark 14 grenade can be modified in the field for special purposes. Common modifications include high explosive, flashbang, and thermite paste incendiary charges. More exotic varieties include charged particle proton charges, Bose-Einstein "cryo" condensates, and cobalt-salted micro-nukes.”

[24]
Weapons, Armor and Equipment: Weapons: Javelin[]

“The Javelin is an experimental close-assault weapon fitted on a handful of newer Alliance warships. It consists of a rack of two or more disposable disruptor torpedo tubes bolted or magnetically slung on to a ship's exterior armored hull. The torpedoes are fired on converging trajectories, and detonate in a precisely timed sequence that allows the dark energy emitted by their warheads to resonate. This magnifies the resulting space-time warp effects.

Javelin mounts are most often fitted on swift frigates, which expect to enter 'knife fight' torpedo ranges as a matter of course. Javelins may also be fitted on heavier ships during short range engagements, such as trans-relay assaults. They are particularly useful in this role for dreadnoughts, which are unable to lay their main guns on targets at close range.”

Galaxy Map Descriptions[]



Asteroid 718 HasebeHasebe is a rocky asteroid with no atmosphere and little gravity. It has been equipped with three crude fusion torches, which are being used to move it into the orbit of the nearby planet Proteus. On its current trajectory it will actually strike the colony.

[70]





Bonestell PlatformBonestell Mars Observation Platform was built in 2150, with major funding provided by the national space agencies of the United States and Japan. It is currently administered by the Systems Alliance, which assumed control of all Martian interface facilities in 2163. The SA is now solely responsible for the security of Mars' Prothean excavation sites.


Bonestell Platform maintains an orbit that keeps it on the opposite side of the planet from the natural satellite of Deimos. That moon has been built up as a communications hub and shipping port. Bonestell serves the same communications role on the hemisphere of Mars facing away from Deimos. Since all commercial traffic is channeled through the security checkpoints on Deimos, Bonestell lacks significant port facilities.

[71]





CalestonGeysers of molten suphur dot the rugged landscape of this volcanic moon, its atmosphere a toxic layer of sulphur dioxide. Eldfell-Ashland Energy established mining operations on Caleston to extract the scattered deposits of element zero leftover from an ancient meteor strike, making this moon the largest source of starship drive core material in the Attican Traverse.

[72]





DeimosThe larger of Mars' two tiny moons has been built up as an orbital port. Initially developed by a consortium of European and Russian commercial backers, administration was handed over to the Systems Alliance in 2163.

Today Deimos serves as an entrepot for cargo moving to and from the surface, as well as a customs inspection and medical quarantine for immigrants and visitors. All departures from Mars must pass through Deimos' screening facilities; given the possibility of private explorers discovering Prothean artifacts, all baggage undergoes a thorough inspection.

The Systems Alliance 1st Fleet, nominally based in Arcturus, maintains a cruiser squadron and frigate flotilla at Deimos. They are tasked with protecting the Prothean ruins and assisting customs enforcement.

Founded: 2124
Population: 2700 permanent residents
Capital: Asaph Hall Gateway Facility

Orbital Distance:  23,460 km (from Mars)
Orbital Period: 30.2 Earth Hours
Mean Radius: 6.3 km
Day Length: 30.2 Earth Hours
Atmospheric Pressure: Trace

Surface Temperature: -40 Celsius

Equipment[]
Manufacturers[]
The following manufacturers' gear is not normally accessible in-game (unless stated otherwise):

Batarian State Arms



Batarian State ArmsThe batarian government does not trust private industry to create their military hardware. BSA is a vast nationalized institution infamous for its waste and corruption. It produces effective, if unethical, chemical weapons and a line of Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological (NBC) protective armor.

[80]
Cerberus Skunkworks



Cerberus SkunkworksThe operatives of Cerberus produce their own specialist hardware for black ops wetwork. Their weapons are advanced particle beams with excellent shield penetration, damage, and accuracy. Their field hardsuits feature advanced protective measures and sophisticated anti-hacking measures.

[81]
Hahne-Kedar Shadow Works



Hahne-Kedar Shadow WorksFounded a decade ago, this Hahne-Kedar subsidiary is a place for younger employees to "think outside the box". HKSW supplies weapons and armor to Alliance special forces units. In keeping with the parent company's corporate philosophy, products are rugged, reliable, and require less maintenance than competitors.

[82]
Jormangund Technology



Jormangund TechnologyA rising star of post-contact human industry, Jormangund returns consistent profits through aggressive integration of alien technologies. Mainly known for advanced optical computers and AI "blueboxes," the company has recently developed a "micro gravitic" personal weapon that effectively fires small disruptor torpedoes.

[83]
Additionally, there were several other manufacturers that cannot be found in the game:

Ahial Syndicate[84]
Fal 3 Manufactory[85]



Fal 3 ManufactoryFal 3 is a privately-owned planet in salarian space. An entire world devoted to the industrial process, its primary revenue stream is generated by the construction and sale of private spacecraft. To supplement income, Fal 3 Manufactory has launched a line of prototype omni-tools, though they are expensive and extremely rare.

[86]
Ihiko Defense Labs[87]
Kahai Genetics[88]
Kinshasa Fabrications[89]



Kinshasa FabricationsA human-controlled private company, Kinshasa Fabrications is known to make the finest body armor in the galaxy. When it comes to personal protection suits, no expense is spared - as reflected in the exorbitant cost of their products.

Harpoon Rounds



Harpoon RoundsHarpoon rounds are built of material that condenses on impact to penetrate armor, then shreds into shrapnel in the softer medium of flesh. They are widely considered unethical.

[103]
Hyper Rail



Hyper RailA hyper rail upgrade extends the barrel of a weapon and "overclocks" its mass accelerator equipment. Its hypervelocity slugs impact with enough force to be useful against light armored vehicles, but produce significant heat and recoil.
