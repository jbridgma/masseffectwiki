This article is about the turian corporation. For the adversary featured in the first Mass Effect game, see Elanos Haliat.


One of the smaller turian weapons manufacturers, Haliat Armory was given permission by the Hierarchy to sell excess units on the galactic market. Rather than trying to compete with high end manufacturers, Haliat specializes in a line of basic level weapons. Regardless, their weapons are of high quality and have high stats.
A licence for Haliat Armory gear can be purchased from Ledra at Zhu's Hope on Feros for a cost of 6,250 credits. 


Weapons[]
All weapons manufactured by Haliat Armory incorporate absorbent recoil technology, resulting in better performance across the board in comparison to most other weapons.[1]

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 48: Haliat Armory's Absorbent Recoil gives +30% to Damage, +2% to Heat Absorption and +10% Accuracy. Compared to baseline stats, while calculations for Damage appear correct, the other two don't match the given percentage, though a clear increase can be observed.
