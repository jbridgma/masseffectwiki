Caleston: Reactivate Production is an assignment in Mass Effect which was cut during development. It involved helping Caleston's refinery maintenance officer Wren Carson with repairs.

Acquisition[]
This mission would have been acquired by talking to Wren Carson down in the Throw Down refinery and by offering to help with her problem. It would have become unavailable after Commander Shepard leaves Throw Down to find Liara T'Soni in the Ring of Fire.

Plotline[]

In the refinery, talking with the maintenance officer Wren Carson, she may mention that the south pipeline is down because the pyrolines are experiencing a mechanical failure and one of the gravitic stills has a breach. Since she won't send her people to go fix them due to the ongoing unrest with the gangs, Shepard may offer to do it instead. On the way there however, just as expected, Shepard comes across a brewing conflict between Cartel and Union men. Shepard may decide to side with either gang, or try to stay out of it, which results in both sides attacking Shepard. After dealing with this, fixing the issues may be attempted by Shepard if they have technical training, or if accompanied by Tali'Zorah nar Rayya, Kaidan Alenko or Garrus Vakarian. Afterwards, Shepard may report back to Wren Carson, who acts surprised but grateful.
After Liara has been rescued, Shepard may come across Wren Carson again on the Plaza if the above was completed and Tombiri is still the administrator in charge (since Wren Carson would take up her post otherwise). She simply informs Shepard that the south line is up again and leaves.
