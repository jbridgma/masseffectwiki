Aegohr Munitions is a shop located on the Presidium Commons in the Citadel. The kiosk is on the upper level of the Meridian Place Market, right next to Cipritine Armory. 
Purchases from Aegohr Munitions show up in their customers' credit report as "AM Trading Limited". The shop takes pride in its customer service representatives always eager to buy new tech, as well as deals "you never see coming."






“There won't be an Earth left to save...” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 3 follow.




A human demands a refund for his out-of-stock toaster oven from the store despite missing the original receipt, having visited the location ten times in the past week and claiming the manager allowed him to get a refund if he made an appointment. Commander Shepard can intervene and support either the sales clerk or the customer. The customer gets a 15-credit refund if Shepard supports him, and backs off if Shepard supports the clerk, who was supposed to be on break and attempting to contact his family amidst the ongoing war.
Like its neighboring store Aegohr Munitions is run by two salarians. After the Cerberus attack on the Citadel, it gains a turian behind the counter. The turian and one of the salarians may be found arguing about how to best defend themselves against terrorist attacks. The turian is angry and wants relaxed restrictions on weapon sales while the salarian is worried about scared civilians getting trigger-happy. Shepard can intrude on their argument and support either view, which leads to consequences on the Citadel's security assessment.

Trivia[]
Aegohr is one of the salarians' first three colonies.
Text of the shop's audio blurbs within the game's files consistently spell Aegohr as Aeghor.
