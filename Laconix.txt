Description[]
Laconix is far enough from its F-class star that its temperatures are almost tolerable to sapient life, but its extremely thin atmosphere makes it almost as hostile as a vacuum. As such, the planet was uninhabited. Mining drones, piloted from orbital stations, would brave the high gravity to extract iridium, osmium, and other valuable heavy metals.
The Reapers did not overlook Laconix in their sweep of the system, and the orbital stations are now destroyed.

Additional Information[]
The signal from the artifact in Dr. Bryson's Lab bounced through this planet, making it a candidate for Leviathan's location. Closer inspection or luck can debunk this, however, as the real location is in 2181 Despoina.
