“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Dr. Harihn is stationed in the Angaran Resistance Base where he heals wounded angara with his assistant Trae. Due to the war against the kett, he is stressed by the increasing number of wounded and is short on supplies. According to him, emergency medical caches can be used by wounded fighters to survive long enough to reach a clinic with real medical attention. However, those caches are currently empty and no one has been out there to replenish them.
When he first meets Pathfinder Ryder, he is not impressed by Ryder and offers an icy welcome. According to him, as the Pathfinder has no knowledge of specific healing from the Milky Way, Ryder is of no use to him. However, assistant Trae suggests that Ryder could use his vehicle to resupply the emergency medical caches scattered across the planet.
If Ryder helps, Dr. Harihn is grateful and says that Ryder has saved many lives. He's set aside some supplies for Ryder from one of the shipments.
