Description[]
The geological properties of Salamis have been scanned from orbit, but little else is known about it. Due to its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and proximity to the energetic star Athens, the equatorial daytime temperatures have been known to turn the surface molten. The crust is composed of iron with deposits of platinum group metals.

Trivia[]
In Greek mythology Salamis was a Nymph. She resided on the island of Salamis (named after her) which is best remembered as the location of a decisive naval battle between the Greeks and the Persians.
