Description[]
A small hydrogen-nitrogen gas giant, Bast and its moons served as the Eclipse mercenary company's fallback position after their defeat on Neith. Once they had gathered their strength they leaked a false position to the Na'hesit consortium to lure them into a trap, which devolved into a pitched battle. Both sides claimed victory. Na'hesit lost more ships but could afford the setback in a way Eclipse could not.
