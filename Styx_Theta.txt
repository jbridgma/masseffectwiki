Styx Theta lies uncomfortably close to the "Five Kiloparsec Ring" around the galactic core. Much of this area is too dangerous to safely travel, and thus barely explored. None of the known worlds within are habitable, and there are only a few viable sites for resource prospecting.

The cluster likely derives its name from the river Styx, which divided the Earth from Hades, the underworld. The systems in this cluster are also named for other geographic aspects of the ancient Greek underworld.
