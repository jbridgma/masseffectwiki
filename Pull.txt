This article is about the biotic power Pull in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. For the Pull skill in Mass Effect: Andromeda, see Pull (skill).

Pull is a biotic power in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3's single-player and multiplayer modes. 
Pull generates a mass-lowering field, which levitates enemies into the air. While aloft, enemies will slowly drift towards the player, allowing any allies or the player to finish them off effortlessly. 
With certain evolutions of Pull, it is possible to lift multiple opponents with one use. However, only one Pull can be maintained at a time per user. For example, if the player uses Pull to lift one enemy and then casts Pull again on a different enemy, the previous Pull's effects will end, releasing any enemies held aloft, unless those enemies were also affected by the second Pull.
Note:  When fired by Shepard, this power travels in the direction of the cross-hair, arcing towards the target. When fired by a squad member, this power will travel in a straight line, instantly hitting the target.

Player Notes[]
Any enemy lifted or ragdolled by biotics is unable to attack and takes double damage from normal weapons. Almost any basic unprotected enemy can be pulled into the air where they can be easily and safely eliminated. On Hardcore and Insanity difficulties, all enemies have an additional layer of protection that has to be removed before Pull can lift them.
Lighter enemies affected by Pull will float towards Shepard, stopping if they hit any obstacle. Pull will not inflict collision damage on enemies, though suspended enemies can take minor fall damage after the effect ends. Be wary of a pulled enemy landing behind you where it can recover and attack you from behind your own cover. Medium-sized enemies such as krogan will not float as far or as high.
Very large enemies such as Geth Primes and YMIR Mechs can be ragdolled by Pull when they are unprotected, but they will not become airborne.
Unprotected Husks die instantly when lifted off the ground. As husks often rush you while crowded together, Pull Field can be effective against them. Be careful about pulling Abominations, as they will usually fly towards you and they explode on death.
A target will be drawn in the direction Pull struck them, allowing Shepard to Pull enemies sideways or vertically depending on how the projectile is aimed. If an enemy is crouching behind a barricade and Shepard aims Pull so it arcs over the barricade and hits the target from above, then the enemy will be pulled almost straight up, rather than towards Shepard.
Pull can be combined with a force-imparting power such as Throw or Charge to send enemies flying long distances.
Warp can detonate targets affected by Pull for massive bonus damage to the target as well as additional damage in a large area around it.
Warp Ammo deals additional damage against targets lifted by biotic fields.
A suspended target may die instantly when the Pull effect ends and they fall into an invalid area, bottomless pit, or their recovery animation randomly fails. This can be used strategically in many areas. A short duration Pull can sometimes be more useful for dropping enemies down holes than a long duration, which can sometimes last long enough to carry an enemy safely across gaps.
Pull slightly damages protected enemies and may stagger them.
Pull can be somewhat glitchy, where enemies without any protection that should be lifted sometimes won't be affected. This is rare, but it does happen.

Player Notes[]
Mechanics
The stated value for the Lift Damage evolution is affected by power damage bonuses; 20 (or 75 in multiplayer) is the base damage.
While Pull may not lift armored or shielded enemies off their feet, it will often stun them briefly.
Against Cerberus Guardians or CAT6 Heavies, Pull will the shields from their hands and force them to stumble forward, leaving them vulnerable. Hitting Guardians (not a Heavies) from behind has the same effect as Singularity: it will lift them, resulting in them permanently dropping their shields.
Pull, like all biotics that travel, will arc towards the target enemy which is highlighted. Therefore, you can use it aiming slightly away from a target, affecting the trajectory of the resulting pull. The side of the enemy, on which it hits, will be the direction the enemy goes, with mildly unpredictable results from the rank 4 Radius evolution.
Pull has a very fast cooldown, and the fastest base recharge time of all multiplayer powers. Compared to Throw, Pull can be reduced to as little as 0.77 seconds of recharge time, 21% faster than its closest competitor at 0.93 seconds.
Pull can prime targets it lifts for Biotic Explosions, though as with most force-based biotics, this only works against totally unprotected (red bar) infantry targets. It likewise will not affect Seeker Swarms though they are technically unprotected.
When using Double Pull on an orange-colored Cerberus energy wall, the wall will overload and electrocute anyone using it as cover.
In multiplayer only, Pull deals 100 damage when it hits an enemy.
Care should be taken when using Pull on Abominations and especially Possessed Abominations as these enemies violently detonate. Pull may bring these enemies directly into the proximity of the player or allies.
Strategies
Pull is invaluable for dislodging unprotected enemies from cover.
Pull's extremely fast cooldown can make it easy to spam as often as needed even when carrying very heavy weapon loadouts.
