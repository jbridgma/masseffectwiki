Pfeiffer is a system southeast of the Heleus Cluster's Black Hole. The black hole itself is accessible from within the system. It is one FTL jump away from Pytheas, Eriksson, Faroang, and Zheng He.
Like many systems in the cluster, Pfeiffer is inhospitable, with several resource prospects trapped by hostile environments.
According to Kallo Jath, Pfeiffer was the farthest the Nexus surveyors explored before the uprising. The exiles are known to have made a stop here before their diaspora to the entire cluster.
