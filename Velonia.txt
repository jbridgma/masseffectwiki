Velonia is a salvager located at The Paradise on Elaaden. She tends to mind her own business but trades salvage with anyone who wants to trade. Velonia routinely heads to Kadara for business.






“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Velonia may be questioned by Pathfinder Ryder regarding Kent Halsey's quest finding his sister Isabel. Velonia doesn't know much but is able to provide the location of a scavenger base far to the west in the Sea of Ataraxia.
During Ryder's search for Ljeta, Rorik at New Tuchanka refers the Pathfinder to Velonia for information on Ljeta's whereabouts. Velonia says that she took her to Kadara and didn't ask any questions. Colt Dalton at the Kadara Port may have more information.
In the course of looking for suitable test subjects for Lexi's anti-neural decay serum, Ryder may point their scanner at Velonia. The turian notices this and suspiciously questions Ryder's actions. The Pathfinder then apologizes and scans elsewhere. However, SAM's data indicates that Velonia has unusually high glucocorticoid hormones and below average reaction times, meaning she has increased aggression and possible cerebral deterioration. She shares this condition with several other Elaaden denizens.
