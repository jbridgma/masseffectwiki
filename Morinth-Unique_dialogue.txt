Unique Dialogue[]
If Morinth is brought along to confront the Shadow Broker, he will express surprise that Liara has brought along "the justicar", given her "changed agenda". This seems to suggest that, while he has noticed the difference in her behavior, even the Shadow Broker is unaware that Morinth has assumed her mother's identity.
Talk to Squad Mate[]
Tuchanka: On Fortack's lab in the Urdnot Camp, at the first examination table, Morinth claims that she loves krogan because they are passionate and violent, although they burn out quickly. If Grunt is present, he calls her an asari slut and she retorts that she loves when he's angry. If Mordin is present, he talks about about high krogan birthrates resulting in less emphasis on each individual, to which Morinth responds with a bored-sounding "Inspiring." This is the only instance where Morinth speaks in her real voice in the presence of other squad members.
Spontaneous[]
Sometimes Morinth will say something spontaneously, without being prompted.

When using Dominate she sometimes tells the enemies to "Behold the power of the Ardat-Yakshi."
