Description[]
Maklan is the outermost planet of the Indris system, a ball of rock and ice with a methane-argon atmosphere. Like Hiba, it has an unstable orbit, but where Hiba is believed to have formed closer to the star and gradually moved outward, Maklan is believed to have formed further from Indris and moved inward. Far in the future, Maklan may become a satellite of its gas giant neighbor.
