Description[]
A large terrestrial planet, Antinax has been passed over by the turians and potential investors alike. When the turians won the planet from the krogan, they sought to sell mineral rights, but ultimately found no buyers. One survey team dubbed it "a stinking world with nothing to recommend it but brimstone and bad steel," and, like Gellix, the planet was soon forgotten.
Despite being farther from its parent star than Gellix, Antinax has a thick atmosphere of nitrogen, methane, and ethane--greenhouse gases that retain significant heat. There are four valuable minerals on Antinax, the most abundant being sulfur and iron.
