Player Notes[]
Biotic Slash is basically a biotic version of Electric Slash. It has a lengthy execution which leaves the player vulnerable when out in the open. Caution should be used around dangerous enemies that can rapidly close to melee range, such as Abominations, Brutes, and teleporting Banshees.
It is recommended to use this power in a similar manner as one would with Smash by standing behind cover to counteract this vulnerability.
If Biotic Slash is cancelled with a dodge before the projectiles are launched, a cooldown will not be triggered.
The user moves forward slightly while casting Electric Slash, so caution should be used near drops and ledges as the user can fall off. This can be avoided by holding the movement stick back while firing the effect.
The acrobatic sword animation prior to the shockwave animation does minor damage to targets around you.
Biotic Slash can detonate all four types of Power Combos. The Slayer lacks any ability to prime such combos itself, however, except through the use of appropriate ammo mods, so teaming up with allies with good combo priming powers such as Warp or Incinerate is desirable.
Just like with Shockwave, using this power near someone trying to aim down a scope can disrupt their ability to get a precise shot due to the nature of the animation.
This is an immensely powerful biotic power, especially if power damage bonuses from various sources are combined. The biotic effect travels through all physical objects and does so for a significant distance. This is very useful during static objectives where the team has to be in one spot, as this effect by itself can take down multiple enemies at a time. This allows the rest of the team to concentrate on the more powerful enemies without getting swarmed by extraneous threats.
