Introduction[]
Pre-Order Disc[]
Casey Hudson: Hi. I'm Casey Hudson, project director on Mass Effect, and thanks for pre-ordering the game. Now, to show our appreciation, we put a whole bunch of really cool stuff on this disc. We've got Mass Effect-themed blades, we've got gamer pics, and we've got tracks from the musical score, and a whole bunch of other content you can't get anywhere else. So, thanks again for being as excited about Mass Effect as we are. Enjoy the disc.

Limited Collector's Edition and Platinum Hits Discs[]
Casey Hudson: Hi. I'm Casey Hudson, project director on Mass Effect. Now, it took a team of 120 people here at BioWare, and countless others around the world, to complete this truly enormous project. And to show you how we did it, we've created documentaries, a special selection of music from the soundtrack, and you can view hundreds of images in the design galleries, with  commentary by the actual artists themselves. Enjoy.
