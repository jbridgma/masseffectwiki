(End of conversation)

(Only if Shepard is male)
Maddie Kedward: Nice gun you have there, sailor. You're new in town? Looking for some fun?

(Par) I'm not a sailor. (Neu) What was that? (Ren) Just sight-seeing.  Shepard: Sailor? I am an Alliance marine.Maddie Kedward: Oh... I could give you a good brushing.
(Par) No need, thanks. (Neu) Slow down a bit. (Ren) No. Definitely not.  Shepard: We can keep whatever hairstyle we want after basic training.Maddie Kedward: (giggles) So cute. That's not what I meant, but it's alright. I'm Maddie. Did you come here for the mining business, or just to enjoy streetfights? Shepard: Aren't you going a bit fast?Maddie Kedward: Fast, slow... I can do whichever you want, sugar. I'm Maddie. Did you come here for the mining business, or just to enjoy streetfights? Shepard: If I wanted a piece of meat, I'd go to the butcher.Maddie Kedward: (giggles) Your loss. I'm Maddie. Did you come here for the mining business, or just to enjoy streetfights? Shepard: What kind of "fun" are we talking about?Maddie Kedward: A little of this, a little of that. You won't know till you've tried, right? I'm Maddie. Did you come here for the mining business, or just to enjoy streetfights? Shepard: Right now, I'm just enjoying the view.Maddie Kedward: (giggles) Here? Over here, you can see a yellow rock. And on your right, a reddish rock. I'm Maddie. Did you come here for the mining business, or just to enjoy streetfights?
(Neu) Goodbye. (Inv) Investigate  Shepard: I should go.Maddie Kedward: Come back soon.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Maddie Kedward: Nice to see you again. Wanna buy me a drink?(Return to last choice)

(giggles) Just kidding. I'm a walking, talking entertainer... though most people prefer when I "entertain."
(P Inv) Sounds tough. (R Inv) Seems you like it.  Shepard: How did you end up in this line of work?Maddie Kedward: The Union gave me a ride off of Earth. This job's how I repay them. They call it "contractual transit."
(P Inv) Interesting.  Shepard: I've never heard of anything like that.Maddie Kedward: It's an aid program for the poorer citizens of Earth, to start a new life in the colonies. On paper, it's nice and legal. Except once you get here, you end up treated like a slave. Do you think I wanted to be a whore?
(P Inv) You should speak out.  Shepard: Why don't you file a complaint?Maddie Kedward: To who? Eldfell-Ashland? They say it's a Union concern. Earth? The Citadel? They have no authority here. You know why I came here? I heard the stories about starting a new life on the frontier.
(P Inv) I owe the Alliance.  (Only if Shepard is Earthborn)Shepard: Many people would do anything to escape poverty back home. Some join the navy.Maddie Kedward: You're from Earth? And now you're an Alliance officer, right? You sure have had it good.
(P Inv) I'm sorry. (R Inv) "Had it good"? Really?  Shepard: I didn't mean to offend you.Maddie Kedward: Don't worry. It's nice to see someone from back home made it. It gives us hope, right?(Return to overarching choice)
(Sole Survivor background) (War Hero background) (Ruthless background)  Shepard: I've seen my unit get wiped out by thresher maws, so don't tell me I've "had it good." Shepard: I was on Elysium during the Skyllian Blitz. I've seen many friends die there, so don't tell me I've "had it good." Shepard: I've trudged knee-deep in the blood of slave pits on Torfan, so don't tell me I've "had it good."
Maddie Kedward: Okay, okay, relax already! No need to get worked up! I guess no one's got it easy.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: You look happy. Enjoying your work?Maddie Kedward: If I looked unhappy, if I was crying, would you still want to sleep with me? I've got a quota to fulfill.(Return to last choice) Shepard: Fights seem rather common here. Why is that?Maddie Kedward: It all comes down to the refinery. The Union and the Cartel are trying to squeeze this station for all it's worth. The Union controls all the heavy machinery, and the Cartel holds the refining labs... and both want it all.(Return to last choice) Shepard: Any work available around here?Maddie Kedward: I don't think you'd be interested in my line of work. The Cartel isn't hiring, so that only leaves Tombiri. Go ask her.(Return to last choice)

Matthew Baudelaire: Hello, sweetheart. Looking for someone to show you around?

(Par) Thanks for the offer. (Neu) Meaning? (Ren) Just sight-seeing.  Shepard: Sorry to disappoint, but I'm not a tourist.Matthew Baudelaire: I don't doubt it. I meant to say I can take you to a world of unforgettable experiences.
(Par) Tempting. (Neu) Ugh... (Ren) No. Definitely not.  Shepard: You certainly have a way with words.Matthew Baudelaire: Your face inspires me, sweetheart. Matthew Baudelaire, at your service. Are you here for mining, or just to watch streetfights? Shepard: I'm starting to feel a bit nauseous.Matthew Baudelaire: Not because of me, I hope. Matthew Baudelaire, at your service.

Shepard: What is it you're offering exactly?Matthew Baudelaire: Let's just say that mere chit-chat would be a tragic waste of my skillful tongue. Matthew Baudelaire, at your service.

(P Inv) What led you to this? (R Inv) Seems you like it.  Shepard: How did you end up in this line of work?Matthew Baudelaire: They paid for my ticket off of Earth. I work to pay them back. They call it "contractual transit."
(P Inv) Interesting. (R Inv) This can't be legal.  Shepard: I've never heard of anything like that.Matthew Baudelaire: Ah, contractual transits have been all the rage for a couple of years. They take the poor off of Earth and give them work. The problem is some people on the frontier may end up treated like slaves. The Alliance can't be everywhere, can it?
(P Inv) I owe the Alliance. (R Inv) You should speak out.  (Only if Shepard is Earthborn)Shepard: Many people would do anything to escape poverty back home. Some join the navy.Matthew Baudelaire: I could've sworn you came from the stars, like other angels.
(P Inv) Oh, you... (R Inv) Stop that, or else.  Shepard: I doubt many angels are as well armed as I am.Matthew Baudelaire: I did notice your moves were quite... graceful.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: Keep that up and I'll show you some feminine delicacy.Matthew Baudelaire: Then I can only hope you'll let me die delicately, my lady.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: Why don't you file a complaint?Matthew Baudelaire: We have a security officer, but even if he wasn't drunk all the time, he'd still be powerless.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: The Alliance wouldn't stand for this kind of practice.Matthew Baudelaire: Of course. But the Alliance can't keep track of everything going on out here. Some people practically end up like slaves.
(R Inv) You should speak out.  Shepard: Why don't you file a complaint?Matthew Baudelaire: We have a security officer, but even if he wasn't drunk all the time, he'd still be powerless.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: You look happy. Enjoying your work?Matthew Baudelaire: I don't mind. Getting paid to make love every night? Yes, please.(Return to last choice) Shepard: Fights seem rather common here. Why is that?Matthew Baudelaire: Ah, the Union and the Cartel. They've been fighting over the refinery since the Cartel landed.(Return to last choice) Shepard: Any work available around here?Matthew Baudelaire: Certainly. The administrator would know of any job openings. Go see her at her office.(Return to last choice)

Tatiana Naidenov: No! Please. Leave him alone.
Sebastian Van Heerden: As you wish. Last time I gave him a lesson, he was too drunk to even notice.

(Neu) Goodbye. (Inv) Who are you?  Shepard: I should go.Jason Harrah: Yeah, sure, go ahead.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Jason Harrah: What do you want, [boy/girl]? Shepard: Are you the one in charge of security around here?Jason Harrah: Jason Harrah. I'm Eldfell-Ashland's security officer. Anywhere else, that would mean lecturing drones who are running with scissors. Jason Harrah: What do you want, [boy/girl]?
(Neu) Goodbye. (Inv) Investigate  Shepard: I should go.Jason Harrah: Yeah, sure, go ahead.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Jason Harrah: What do you want, [boy/girl]?(Return to last choice)
(Neu) Return (Inv) Gang trouble (Inv) Break-up (Inv) Tatiana (Inv) Krogan mercenary  (Return to overarching choice) (Only if Shepard has completed the bore mission)Shepard: What would I need to take down the Union and the Cartel?Jason Harrah: If you show up with a badge, they'll get a good laugh before they start breaking your bones. To convict them, the workers could provide all the testimony needed. Problem is they're all scared of getting killed in retaliation.
(P Inv) Union boss (R Inv) Smiley  Shepard: What do you know about the boss of the Union?Jason Harrah: Not much, seems she's always bunked in her office at the refinery. Even I can't get in. We only get in contact with her right arm. A killer for hire named Sessa Tarrent.
(P Inv) A merc?  Shepard: "Killer for hire?" You mean she's a mercenary?Jason Harrah: Nah, she's a goddamned murderer. A killer for hire. She has quite a reputation.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: What can you tell me about Smiley?Jason Harrah: He's not right in the head. Like an angry, oversized kid whose idea of fun is tearing the wings off a fly. It would be easier to get rid of him without his brother. It's Raciloma who bought him the medbay he lives in.
(R Inv) Some family business.  Shepard: Smiley's brother works for him?Jason Harrah: Cold-hearted son of a bitch, that one. Used to be a mercenary before he came here to help him out.(Return to overarching choice) (Only if Shepard has learned about it)Shepard: What happened between you and Tatiana?Jason Harrah: What happened is that I've been a complete fool. I paid for her, I'm not proud of it. But when you've been here long enough, you start craving some warmth and... affection. I eventually realized I was wooing her, and she didn't seem to mind. So I made a deal with the Union. I could see her if I looked the other way with their dealings.
(Par) You did what? (Neu) Sounds fair. (Ren) Big deal. (P Inv) Some people are like that. (R Inv) Crappy excuse.  Shepard: You made a deal with the Union's boss?Jason Harrah: With Sessa. For a woman's love, I let her get away with blackmailing and murdering. I'm such a damned fool. I loved that woman with all my being, but all I managed was putting her in danger. Shepard: A reasonable agreement. Everyone got what they wanted.Jason Harrah: Eh. That's what I told myself. But I had actually sold my honor. The only thing a man's got in life. I'm such a damned fool. I loved that woman with all my being, but all I managed was putting her in danger. Shepard: Okay, you sold yourself for a woman. And then?Jason Harrah: I'm such a damned fool. I loved that woman with all my being, but all I managed was putting her in danger. (Only if Shepard has the Colonist background)Shepard: I've seen that a lot on Mindoir. People getting together to fight loneliness, eventually cheating on their partner.Jason Harrah: Don't compare me to a cheating husband. If my heart were to go to anyone, lonely or not, it would be to Rosie Palms.
(Par) You did what? (Neu) Sounds fair. (Ren) Big deal.  Shepard: You made a deal with the Union's boss?Jason Harrah: With Sessa.

I loved that woman with all my being, but all I managed was putting her in danger. (Only if Shepard has the Colonist background)Shepard: I grew up on Mindoir, same distance from Earth as Caleston. Yet I managed.Jason Harrah: Fantastic. You want a medal or something?
(Par) You did what? (Neu) Sounds fair. (Ren) Big deal.  Shepard: You made a deal with the Union's boss?Jason Harrah: With Sessa.

I loved that woman with all my being, but all I managed was putting her in danger.
(Par) Did you let them? (Neu) That merc. (Ren) You're corrupt.  Shepard: You tried to oppose the Union, right?Jason Harrah: That Van Heerden... He works for the Union. When their war with the Cartel began, he took her away. He said if I tried anything, he'd break her neck. When I tried to talk to her... she said she didn't need me anymore. That I should disappear. She may have even said she never loved me. Though I'm not sure of that. I was pretty out of it.
(If Shepard didn't meet Van Heerden) (If Shepard met Van Heerden)  Shepard: That mercenary won't let you near her.Jason Harrah: That Van Heerden... He works for the Union. When their war with the Cartel began, he took her away. He said if I tried anything, he'd break her neck. When I tried to talk to her... she said she didn't need me anymore. That I should disappear. She may have even said she never loved me. Though I'm not sure of that. I was pretty out of it. Shepard: You mean that mercenary at the bar?Jason Harrah: That Van Heerden... He works for the Union. When their war with the Cartel began, he took her away. He said if I tried anything, he'd break her neck. When I tried to talk to her... she said she didn't need me anymore. That I should disappear. She may have even said she never loved me. Though I'm not sure of that. I was pretty out of it. Shepard: I can't believe you'd cooperate with those criminals.
(If Shepard hasn't told Harrah about destroying the Union) (If Shepard has)  Jason Harrah: You're one to talk. How's the Union treating you? That Van Heerden... He works for the Union. When their war with the Cartel began, he took her away. He said if I tried anything, he'd break her neck. When I tried to talk to her... she said she didn't need me anymore. That I should disappear. She may have even said she never loved me. Though I'm not sure of that. I was pretty out of it. Jason Harrah: I didn't say I was proud of it. That Van Heerden... He works for the Union.

She may have even said she never loved me. Though I'm not sure of that. I was pretty out of it.
(Par) I feel for you. (Neu) So you fell into alcohol. (Ren) That was stupid.  Shepard: I'm sorry. It must have been hell.Jason Harrah: Kind of you to say so.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: And you've been drinking ever since?Jason Harrah: I don't want anyone's pity. She treated me like the fool that I was.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: She made a fool of you and you got piss-drunk?Jason Harrah: I don't want anyone's pity. She treated me like the fool that I was.(Return to overarching choice) (Only if Shepard has heard about Tatiana)Shepard: Can we talk about Tatiana?Jason Harrah: No, but since we're going to anyway, might as well get on with it. It's been a struggle for her. She puts on a brave face, keeps her cool. But have you looked her in the eyes?
(Par) Yes. (Neu) Not really. (Ren) Skip the melodrama.  Shepard: Of course.Jason Harrah: Eyes don't lie. Hers are usually tired. When she smiles, they're empty. When she's tired, her eyes twitch like a beaten child's. When she was with me, her eyes were beaming again. I gave her joy. It's the only meaningful thing I've done in my life. Shepard: I haven't actually talked to her.Jason Harrah: Eyes don't lie. Hers are usually tired. When she smiles, they're empty. When she's tired, her eyes twitch like a beaten child's. When she was with me, her eyes were beaming again. I gave her joy. It's the only meaningful thing I've done in my life. Shepard: Spare me the poetics. What's your point?Jason Harrah: When she was with me, her eyes were beaming again. I gave her joy. It's the only meaningful thing I've done in my life.
(P Inv) You still love her?  Shepard: You really love her? Despite her job? Despite everything she said?Jason Harrah: You think I'm drinking this much whiskey so I can live forever? [sigh] I'm just counting the days until I get reassigned far from this planet.(Return to overarching choice) (Only if Shepard has heard about the krogan)
(If Shepard has heard about the fight) (If Shepard hasn't heard)  Shepard: I heard you got into a fight with a krogan.Jason Harrah: Yeah, he wanted to know where some asari chick was. I told him to settle down. Things were heating up until Tombiri told him T'Soni wasn't here. Shepard: I've heard you've had to deal with a krogan recently.Jason Harrah: I've had to deal with all sorts. He waved his big gun around, asking for an asari to be brought to him. I told him to settle down. Things were heating up until Tombiri told him T'Soni wasn't here.
(P Inv) Where is he?  Shepard: Is he still here?Jason Harrah: Nah, he's gone. Probably looking for that asari of his. Might take him weeks to comb through the ruins. As long as he ain't here, whatever.(Return to overarching choice)

(Par) Don't worry. (Neu) I'm undercover. (Ren) Watch yourself.  Shepard: I mean you no harm.Jason Harrah: Yeah, but how long? I'm not waiting around until your new friends order you to teach me a lesson. Shepard: I've only joined up to destroy it from within.Jason Harrah: Eh... I must be too honest for that kind of thing. But it's not like a drunk like me would know better. Shepard: Only if you get in my way.Jason Harrah: Well, that makes me feel a whole lot better.

(Par) Charmed. (Neu) Tatiana who? (Ren) Speak up.  Shepard: It's a pretty name.Tatiana Naidenov: It's... It's not a good idea to tell me that kind of thing. Shepard: And your last name?Tatiana Naidenov: Naidenov. Shepard: You don't talk much, do you?Tatiana Naidenov: I'm sorry. It's just... It is not wise to talk to me.
Sebastian Van Heerden: Is [he/she] bothering you, Miss Naidenov?
Tatiana Naidenov: No, no. [He/She] was just asking my name.

(Par) You seem overqualified. (Neu) Why are you here? (Ren) Crappy posting you got.  Shepard: A "Screaming Eagle," huh? Why are you here playing bodyguard, Sarge?Sebastian Van Heerden: Miss Naidenov is private property. The Union pays me to keep people away from her. Shepard: And why can't I talk to her, Sergeant?Sebastian Van Heerden: I am not at liberty to discuss my orders, Commander. Miss Naidenov is private property. The Union pays me to keep people away from her. Shepard: Don't you have anything better to do than guarding prostitutes, Sergeant?Sebastian Van Heerden: It's a living, Commander. Miss Naidenov is private property. The Union pays me to keep people away from her.
(Par) I need to talk to her. (Neu) Goodbye. (Inv) That's a bit vague.  Shepard: I wanted to ask her why she broke up with Harrah.Tatiana Naidenov: I didn't--Sebastian Van Heerden: Miss Naidenov, I already told you to keep your pretty mouth shut.Tatiana Naidenov: I... Yes.Sebastian Van Heerden: If you want to talk about the drunkard, go ask him yourself.
(Neu) Goodbye. (Cha) This'll be quick. (Int) I outrank you.  Shepard: Fine, I'm going.Sebastian Van Heerden: [Sir/Ma'am]. Shepard: Is there someone who could give me permission to talk to her?Sebastian Van Heerden: That is restricted information. Apologies. I'll be honest with you, Commander. But only because we're both Alliance, you understand? We told her that if she got anywhere near Harrah, he'd end up swimming in a stream of lava. She told him she never loved him. It was her idea. A convenient lie to protect him. Clever girl. Now Harrah won't even look at her.
(Neu) Is it true, Tatiana? (P Inv) She lied to him? (R Inv) Were those empty threats?

It wasn't hard to fall in love with him.Sebastian Van Heerden: Enough. That'll do. You have your answer, Commander.
(Neu) Goodbye. (Inv) I need more than that.  Shepard: Fine, I'm going.Sebastian Van Heerden: [Sir/Ma'am]. Shepard: I'm not done talking to her.Sebastian Van Heerden: I'm afraid so, Commander. I apologize, I shouldn't have let you talk to her. [Sir/Ma'am]. Shepard: Then she still loves him?Sebastian Van Heerden: For sure, Commander. This dumb chick doesn't have the best poker face, so to speak.(Return to last choice) Shepard: Would you really kill Harrah?Sebastian Van Heerden: That wouldn't be much of a challenge. He can't even hold a gun straight.(Return to last choice)
(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Sebastian Van Heerden: You already talked to her once, and I shouldn't have even allowed it. Sorry, Commander.(End of conversation) Shepard: I think you've misunderstood. I order you to step aside.Sebastian Van Heerden: You are my superior officer. However, I am no longer on active duty. I'll be honest with you, Commander. But only because we're both Alliance, you understand? We told her that if she got anywhere near Harrah, he'd end up swimming in a stream of lava.

(Par) Your love's intact. (Neu) She had no choice. (Ren) You're a coward.  Shepard: She still loves you. Van Heerden told her he'd kill you if she tried to talk to you. Shepard: Van Heerden said he'd kill you if she talked to you. That's why she shut you out. Shepard: Van Heerden told her he'd kill you. And instead of helping her, you started drinking.

Jason Harrah: Damn.
Turian: Get lost, Harrah. We can deal with it.
Human 2: Ha. Then it's fine when you kill one of us?
Human 1: Kill those bastards, Harrah!
Turian: We're handling this, stay out of it.
Human 2: This is like the war on Shanxi. The turians come in, start shooting, and get away with it.
| Garrus Vakarian: This is not justice. Let Harrah handle it.|| Human 1: Shut your beak, turian.
| Ashley Williams: Nobody's getting away with anything. Right, Commander?| Kaidan Alenko: I knew I'd need that course on crowd control eventually.

(Par) Let's calm down. (Neu) Let Harrah arrest him. (Ren) Get ready.  Shepard: Everyone sit down! We'll sort this out.Human 1: Yeah, right. Shepard: Justice will be served! Van Heerden is going to jail.Turian: I piss on your justice. An eye for an eye!Human 1: We can't just let them go around killing people! Shepard: Everyone get out! Lock and load, people!| Urdnot Wrex: Enough fooling around.| Garrus Vakarian: Understood.| Kaidan Alenko: Damn it!| Ashley Williams: Just give the order, Commander.
Jason Harrah: I'm not kidding, Van Heerden.
Sebastian Van Heerden: Your hands are shaking.
Jason Harrah: They're steady enough to blow your damn head off.
Sebastian Van Heerden: Last chance, Harrah. Leave.
Turian: Van Heerden. If Harrah dies, my squad opens fire. Then it gets ugly.
Human 1: Who's got a gun? We'll show these bastards not to mess with Earth.
Turian: Like hell you will!

(Par) Stand down, mercs. (Ren) Stay out of it, miners. (Cha) This isn't your concern anymore. (Int) Listen up, or die.  Shepard: Spilling blood won't do any good!Turian: That's enough. Clear the room!Human 1: Kill those mercs! Shepard: You all shut up and mind your own business!Human 1: Go to hell. Shepard: Step back, all of you! Harrah will handle this.Turian: We'll remember this. Shepard: If I see anyone drawing a gun, I'll blow their head off!Turian: We'll remember this.
