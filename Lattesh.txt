Description[]
Lattesh, translated from a salarian dialect as "it's still winter," has an almost-habitable temperature and abundant water but shows no signs of life. Regular supervolcanic eruptions in the southern hemisphere have shrouded the sun and led to a climate even more bone-chilling than usual.
