Ma-at's sole gas giant is believed to have captured all other planets in the vicinity. There is nothing else of note in the system except moderate resources in Ammut and the geth that mine it for hydrogen.

Ammut[]
Ammut is the first planet orbiting the star Ma-at.

Main article: Ammut
Trivia[]
Ma-at is likely named for the goddess of truth and justice in the ancient Egyptian pantheon.
