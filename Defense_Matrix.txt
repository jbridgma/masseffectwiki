Player Notes[]
Mechanics
The power use penalty at Rank 1 is not a 60% overall reduction to power recharge speed, but a 60% points reduction of the Power Recharge Speed bonus visible in the weapon loadout screen. For example, if you have +200% Power Recharge Speed when looking at the weapons screen, activating Rank 1 Defense Matrix reduces that Power Recharge Speed to +140%.
The power speed penalty reduction of 30% with the Rank 6 Power Recharge evolution reduces the penalty from 60% down to 30%. E.g. If you have +200% Power Recharge Speed bonus from a light weapon loadout, activating Rank 6 Defense Matrix only reduces that to +170%.
Defense Matrix can be activated and purged without interrupting the player while performing other actions such as running and firing a weapon.
The Rank 5 Power Synergy evolution only boosts the damage of actual tech powers such as Overload and not biotic powers or "combat" powers such as Carnage.
The damage protection bonus of Defense Matrix can stack with additional powers such as Tech Armor.
Strategies
Merely activating Defense Matrix does not cause powers to go on cooldown, meaning the power can be "double-tapped": activating then immediately purging for a large shield restore, useful as a quick "panic button." Leaving the matrix inactive doesn't provide the passive damage protection and/or tech power boosts but has the advantage of not slowing power use as much.
The purge is one of the very few methods in single-player to restore shields without waiting for them to recharge normally (Energy Drain being another). This is especially useful against enemy attacks with damage-over-time effects that can delay shield recharge, such as the ranged attacks of Banshees and the acid attacks of Swarmers.
Because of the shield gate mechanic the shield restore can increase the total amount of damage Shepard can survive much more than the amount of shielding would seem to indicate. Particularly on Insanity level, where many attacks will take shields down instantly, regaining any amount of shielding can restore the "gate" and increase by one the number of large bursts of damage Shepard can survive. This effect does have a minimum cooldown of several seconds, however.
Purging an active Defense Matrix can restore shields to an Infiltrator without breaking the invisibility of Tactical Cloak upgraded with the Rank 6 Bonus Power evolution.
