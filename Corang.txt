Description[]
Initial surveys of Corang noted its high density and active plate tectonics, suggesting a high internal heat fueled by a greater than normal concentration of heavy elements and radioactives. Early test cores proved the mineral richness of the world, but distance from the mass relay in the Century system made it unprofitable to develop until late 2183.
The atmosphere is a smog of methane, ammonia, and water vapor, a so-called "primodial [sic] soup" similar to the conditions of early Earth. However, there is no evidence of life developing on Corang's surface beyond the level of simple dextro-amino acids. The minimal energy input of the red dwarf Verr have created an energy-starved surface environment, though the planet's volcanism does hold open some possibility for subterranean development.

Trivia[]
Although the planet description for Corang notes that the Century system has a mass relay, none is shown in-game.  The Chandrasekhar system is the only system in the Hawking Eta cluster shown to possess a mass relay in the Galaxy Map in Mass Effect 2.
