The Triton ADS is a pilotable exploration mech. 
Overview[]
The Triton resembles an Atlas mech and is armed with a rocket launcher and mass accelerator cannon for ground combat situations, but is also capable of underwater exploration. While underwater, it can launch flares. It also has emergency boosters on its back to facilitate rapid ascent to the surface if needed. 
Steve Cortez explains that the Triton is an old military mech model that has been converted for deep sea diving. It appears capable of handling depths of up to 3276 meters of water at a pressure of nearly 4500 Earth atmospheres. However, at this depth the suit begins to buckle under the strain, with its floodlight breaking and audible warping on most of its exterior hull.
