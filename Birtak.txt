Birtak is one of Nakmor Drack's scouts who were captured by the kett.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Birtak and his fellow scouts were taken to Verakan for study and exaltation. During Pathfinder Ryder's infiltration of the kett flagship, Birtak escapes his cell when the EMP devised by a separate salarian team goes off.
If Ryder opts to save the krogan scouts, Birtak meets with them outside Laboratory 34, where the rest of his group are held. He assists in taking down the heavy kett resistance there, relishing in the fight. If Drack is around they insult each other on who has worse aim. Once the enemies are wiped out Birtak takes position near the console that will set the scouts free, but nags the Pathfinder to do it.
Birtak shows up on Meridian later, vowing to repay the scouts' debt by assisting Ryder during their push towards its control center. He helps in taking down the first Ascendant encountered on the way, and stays until Ryder's team descends a gravity well to the control center.
Several weeks after the kett's defeat on Meridian and Hyperion's crash-landing on the world, Birtak appears at Port Meridian and thanks Ryder for inviting him to the party. Not the ongoing celebrations, as Ryder didn't organize anything, but Landing Day, as Birtak deems it worth jumping galaxies.
If Ryder chose the salarians over the scouts, Birtak never meets with them aboard the flagship. The kett successfully turn the scouts into more Behemoths after the first prototype killed by Ryder in the Archon's Chamber. However, he still somehow manages to escape and show up at Port Meridian later during Landing Day festivities.
