Remav is located at a stellar nursery. The Andromeda Initiative targeted it as the location of the turian golden world, though by their arrival the system has changed so much that the local angara only know of Remav as devoid of viable planets. At present, it contains an asteroid field that hosts criminal-run mining ventures.
