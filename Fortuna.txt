Fortuna is a red dwarf. Its name is Latin for "fate", "fortune" or "luck" and is used as the proper name of the Roman goddess of fortune and fate.  
The Fortuna system was initially charted by the Alliance starship Kupe, though only a small probe could be spared for Wentania. One of her crewmen was the poet Sofia Cabral, who was aboard during her tour of duty with the Alliance and who named the planet Amaranthine. Kupe is named after the Polynesian who -- according to some Maori mythologies -- discovered Aotearoa (New Zealand).
