Description[]
Inti is a terrestrial planet with an atmosphere composed of ammonia and helium. Its surface is mainly composed of sodium oxide with deposits of magnesium. Its density is rather low, leaving the planet tide-locked to Matano.
Inti is an unremarkable world, drawing little more than a cursory scan for surface pirate anchorages when Alliance patrols enter the system.

Trivia[]
All planets in the Matano System are named after deities of Inca mythology. Inti is the Inca deity of the sun.
