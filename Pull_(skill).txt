Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Pull only primes a biotic explosion on tapping. It doesn't if used to drag objects or enemies around.
Strategies
Pull has a comparatively fast cooldown, but if not relying on teammates' detonator skills it should be paired with a similarly fast-recharging detonator skill to pull off biotic explosions in rapid succession.
