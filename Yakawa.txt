Yakawa's worlds have substantial resources, even if initial prospects turned out little of interest. Because Maskawa is a volus academic research site, there appears to be a thriving kidnap-for-ransom industry on the system wherein abductees from the planet are brought to Kobayashi's decrepit orbitals for ransom or offsystem slavery.
