During the mission to recruit Thane, the Bounty Hunter descends the lift with two Eclipse Engineers and is killed in the resulting firefight.

The Bounty Hunter is equipped with M-6 Carnifex, which can be armed with Incendiary Ammo to boost his pistol's damage. He can also use Carnage at longer ranges.

Trivia[]
The Bounty Hunter is notable as he is one of only two krogan (along with Kalusk) with a blue shield bar in Mass Effect 2. All others have armor, biotic barriers, or some combination thereof.
The Bounty Hunter's armor seems to indicate that he's normally a member of the Blood Pack. Apparently freelancing with Eclipse is not a problem for him.
