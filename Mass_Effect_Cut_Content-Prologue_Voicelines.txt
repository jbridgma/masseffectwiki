Kaidan Alenko: I'm a little tired, Jenkins.
Richard Jenkins: Ah come on, man! The whole crew's talking about it, let me see! Do something easy, one of the chairs or something.
Kaidan Alenko: [sigh] Alright.
Richard Jenkins: Oof!
Kaidan Alenko: How was that, Jenkins? You want to see it again?
Richard Jenkins: Erm, no... No, I'm good, Lieutenant, I... better head down below.
Karin Chakwas: That was a little extreme. Are you feeling alright, Lieutenant?
Kaidan Alenko: Just a slight headache. Between Jenkins and Joker, there's always someone yapping in my ear.
Karin Chakwas: It's not their fault and you know it. Those damned biotic implants...
Kaidan Alenko: Don't worry about it, I'm okay. Really.

(Par) Scout around. (Neu) Let's go. (Ren) We go in hard and fast. (Inv) Can we fix the vehicle?
