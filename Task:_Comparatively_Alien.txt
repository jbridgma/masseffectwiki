Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Task: Getting to Know the Nexus

Talk to Professor Herik anytime after the first conversation with him during the aforementioned mission. Accept his request for help. After the Tempest's acquisition, Professor Herik can be found at the Tech Lab of the Nexus Docking Bay.
Warning: Declining to participate will lock this task out even after unlocking the scientists' Tech Lab on the Nexus, after the Eos vault's activation. It is highly advisable to accept the task when it is given.

Walkthrough[]
Access the terminal[]
After accepting the mission from Herik, access the nearby terminal to read about the efforts to catalog the organisms that live in the galaxy before either Milky Way or Scourge interference wipes out the native species.




Final Proposal: Prof. N. Herik et al

...since we are, by definition, an invasive species in Andromeda.  Our inevitable footprint must be laid carefully, and we must preserve anything we replace.


The Heleus Cluster presents an unexpected challenge.  We arrived with seed archives and DNA banks to ensure preservation of the biodiversity of the Milky Way.  But this cluster is scarred by the Scourge, and its unique flora and fauna are threatened by its turbulence.  That, too, requires conservation.




Scan Andromeda wildlife[]
You must locate and scan ten of the following unique wildlife samples to complete this mission.
Each sample is worth +50  for a total of +650  (for all samples).
Note: Wildlife scanned while on Habitat 7 during Planetside does not count towards the 10 unique scans required.
The creatures do not need to be alive to be scanned, but must have a corpse left behind; as some of them disintegrate upon death, it can be a challenge to scan some wildlife if your squadmates attack on sight. It might be advisable to direct the team away from the creature you are trying to scan.
