Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Barrier is a passive skill that is always active.
Rank 6 Saving Barrier for both Ryder and Multiplayer Characters triggers at 25 % health, instead of the stated 20 %, and has a cooldown of 15 seconds for both.
Strategies
Rank 6 Active Barrier only takes effect if an enemy is killed with a biotic power, whereas Rank 6 Saving Barrier will always take effect when conditions are met.
If Ryder favors an aggressive Adept profile, or at least specializes in solely biotics, then Rank 6 Active Barrier can help bolster defenses; however, having shields automatically restored at low health is a literal life-saver, and Rank 6 Saving Barrier could be arguably seen as the better option.
Rank 6 Active Barrier stacks with other shield-restoration on kill effects. By using Rank 6 Draining Field on Annihilation and wearing a Shield Oscillator on Ryder's chest armor, it is possible for Ryder to restore 80% of their shields every time they kill an enemy.
