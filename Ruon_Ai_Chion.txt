Mass Effect (cut)


Doctor Ruon Ai Chion is a character cut from Mass Effect during the game's development. He was one of Peak 15's staff scientists studying the rachni.
After the "incident" on Peak 15 occurred, Dr. Chion locked himself in a room in a state of severe mental instability, with the arming key necessary to trigger the neutron purge. Commander Shepard may hear of Dr. Chion's survival in the hot labs from Mira. After finding him, he addresses Shepard through the door and says deliriously he's just waiting for the remote-activated neutron purge to go off.[1] Eventually, Shepard has 2 choices: blow up the door (which kills Chion in the process and angers most squadmates), or persuade Chion to open the door using Charm or Intimidate. If Chion is persuaded, he accompanies the group for a bit, before committing suicide right as one of the squadmates was commenting on his instability to Shepard.[2]
