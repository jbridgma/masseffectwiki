Pay attention to the grunts in the lower decksYour brand-new ship wants a non-critical part from a wretched hive of scum and villainy1/2
The engineers could use new T6-FBA couplings to make their maintenance work easier.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Freedom's Progress (mission)

Anytime after gaining full access to the Normandy, speak with Kenneth Donnelly or Gabriella Daniels on the engineering deck of the ship and ask if there's anything they need.

Walkthrough[]
This Nashan Stellar Dynamics item can be found at Kenn's Salvage on Omega, in the market district. Kenn also gives you the Omega: Struggling Quarian assignment. You can still purchase the couplings from Kenn's terminal even if he has left Omega as a potential result of your actions in his assignment. 


Once completed, you will be rewarded with 40 experience points and invited to play Skyllian-Five poker with the engineers (and Tali if she has been recruited). Depending on your dialogue choices, you can lose or win 100 credits. Charm or Intimidate will win 500 credits. There will be no morality points in either case.

Mass Effect 3 Consequences[]
If this assignment was completed and Kenneth and Gabriella were brought back on board the Normandy, at some point Kenneth or Gabby will tell the Commander that the FBA couplings "are still working great."
