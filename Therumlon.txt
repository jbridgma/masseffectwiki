Description[]
Therumlon is a frigid world with a thick nitrogen-argon atmosphere. The crust contains silicates and unremarkable ores, but is surprisingly rich in phosphates. Since the atmosphere lacks free oxygen, the phosphates are relatively pure and could be of value in the manufacture of fertilizer and incendiary ammunition.

Assignments[]
Survey: UNC: Valuable Minerals: Heavy Metal ×1 (Plutonium)
Properties[]
The atmosphere is not a greenhouse and the sun is a dot in the sky. Given that we should be able to calculate albedo, but that comes out to −83. The readings must be off by orders of magnitude.

Trivia[]
Amaranthine, the third planet in the Fortuna system, has an orbital period nearly three times shorter than Therumlon (12 Years to 31.4 Years). This suggests a probable writing error.
