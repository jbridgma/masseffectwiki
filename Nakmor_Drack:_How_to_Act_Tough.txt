Concerned about Drack
To: Ryder
From: Kesh

Ryder,

I'm worried about my grandfather. He likes to act tough, but he's still an old man and he's been through a lot.

We just talked. He said he's fine, but I could tell he's hurting. After I nagged too much, he promised to go see your ship's doctor.

Can you do me a favor and make sure he does? I need him alive a little longer, please.

Thanks,

Kesh




Check the Tempest medbay[]
Head to the Med Bay on the Tempest. Lexi asks Drack to fight smart because he doesn't have much organ redundancy left. Much of his body is prosthetics and implants. 
Here you learn why Drack has so many health problems. How these problems led him down a dark path until a shaman gave him a little baby krogan girl to take care of. Turns out that baby was Nakmor Kesh. Drack will then give you some advice about parenting.
After the conversation, the mission ends.
