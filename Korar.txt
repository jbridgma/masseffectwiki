Description[]
Korar is a small, lifeless rock blessed with significant deposits of thorium, which is used in radiation shielding and the manufacture of spaceframe alloys. A few miners eke out an existence on the surface, selling their ore at Lorek and praying that the intermittent raids by the Terminus pirate clans will pass their homestead by. There have been no children born on Korar since the infamous pirate raid of 2047, when every child on the planet was rounded up and taken as a slave. Any couple finding themselves pregnant preemptively moves offworld.
