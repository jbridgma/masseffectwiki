There are reports of interesting and potentially lucrative activity in the Remav system. While those reports alone seem vague, it's also the area that the turian ark may have been headed. Vetra and Peebee suggest that we check it out.

When Pathfinder Ryder returns to the Tempest after the first visit to Kadara Port during the mission above, a meeting called by Nakmor Drack is just starting. When the meeting is over this mission begins.

Travel to H-047c in the Remav system.[]
Ryder finds H-047c to be a world torn to pieces by the Scourge. H-047c was meant to be the new homeworld for the turians, but now there are only some exiles on pieces of the world. There is no protective magnetic field so the cosmic radiation is extremely high. Hardsuits won't be able to protect against radiation so the whole squad will have to stay in the ND1 Nomad.
After landing on the ruined rock, the mission completes. 

Aftermath[]
Because the gravity is so low on H-047c, this is an excellent location to earn the Hang Time Achievement (Keep the Nomad airborne for 35 seconds).
