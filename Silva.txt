Description[]
Named for Mateus Silva, leader of the prospector team that unearthed the Prothean Archives on Mars, this ice giant was once home to a large recovery operation for helium-3. In its heyday, the helium-3 flowed freely here to fuel merchant ships commuting from Benning to Arcturus.
All infrastructure on Silva has been destroyed, along with the colony on Oliveira, its moon.
