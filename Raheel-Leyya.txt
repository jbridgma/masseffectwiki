Raheel-Leyya itself is devoid of almost anything noteworthy, but it is a gateway to other systems with much more resources.

Trivia[]
During the development of Mass Effect 2, Raheel-Leyya was once intended to include two additional locations which were cut from the final game: Leyya and Susskind Station.
Although Raheel-Leyya is shown as a binary star system in Mass Effect 2, one of the stars is depicted only by way of a weak, near-transparent lens-flare effect in Mass Effect 3. In the Legendary Edition version of the latter game, the lens flare effects in the system were improved so as to be able to distinguish the two stars.
