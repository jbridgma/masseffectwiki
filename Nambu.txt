Description[]
A hydrogen-helium gas giant, Nambu has an extensive ring system but only twenty moons -- comparatively few. Its moon Sumiko is the smallest moon known to be tectonically active in the Milky Way, covered by bright factures. Visitors to Maskawa often take advantage of Nambu's refueling platforms.

Trivia[]
The world may be named after Yoichiro Nambu, 1/2 recipient of the Nobel Physics Prize 2008. He was awarded for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics.
In keeping with the prevailing system nomenclature, Sumiko appears to be named after physicist Hideki Yukawa's wife[1].
