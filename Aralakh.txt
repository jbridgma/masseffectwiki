Aralakh is a gateway system. The krogan accord their home star a place of significance in their culture: it means "eye of wrath" in their language, and it lends its name to a place in Tuchanka and an elite warrior unit.
All of Aralakh's terrestrial worlds are inhospitable; even the krogan homeworld Tuchanka is barely livable by other races' standards. The Krogan Rebellions saw most resources stripped for the war effort, although there are still some deposits available here and there. 
The Council Demilitarization Enforcement Mission (CDEM) maintains a careful watch on krogan hotspots to prevent something like the Rebellions from happening again. Part of their job is regulating helium-3 fuel sales skimmed from the system's gas giants.
