Description[]
The second asteroid in the system formed around an element zero core, Kakabel is another carbonaceous asteroid, with a surface made of hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clays. Beneath its icy surface is liquid water, with some amino acids. The surface of Kakabel is pitted and scarred with strip-mining stations, where the quarians took as much eezo as possible before moving on.
