Description[]
Ontamalca is a large hydrogen-helium gas giant with traces of chlorine and sulphur in the atmosphere. Its massive gravity well tugs many asteroids from the outer belt inwards, past the orbit of Altaaya and Edolus and eventually settle into the inner belt.
Ontamalca's orbit is congested with hundreds of captured moons. Most last only a few thousand years before being ejected, dragged down into the atmosphere, or ripped apart by tidal forces and added to the gas giant's immense rings. Attempting to navigate this chaotic environment is hazardous at best. Ships without military grade kinetic barriers are likely to suffer catastrophic impacts.
