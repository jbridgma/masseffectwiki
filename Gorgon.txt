The system is named after the gorgons of Greek mythology. Medusa, who was slain by Perseus, is the best known of the three named gorgons. The ancient stories speak of Medusa transforming men into stone when they gazed directly at her. This is reminiscent of how the tidally-locked planets of the system, Wuo and Camaron, have the side that is facing Gorgon perpetually scorched, with the opposite side being completely frozen, thus making colonization impractical at best. Gorgon is classified as a B-type star.
