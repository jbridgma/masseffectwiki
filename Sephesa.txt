Sephesa's star is a massive red giant, likened by Dr. Suvi Anwar to Arcturus back in the Milky Way and described by Kallo Jath to be a more remote version of it.
There's evidence of kett activity in the system, but there are none recent. Its planets are desolate with some mining profitability, and one harbors primitive life.
