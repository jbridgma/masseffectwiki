Compatibilities[]
Chest - This augmentation can be applied to Chest armor pieces.
Guns - This augmentation can be applied to gun-type weapons.
Description[]
When applied on guns, this is a Gun Projectile augmentation. You may apply one such augment to a gun during the development process.
When applied on armor, this is a Special augmentation. You may apply one such augment to an armor piece during the development process.
Automatic Weapons:Weapon now fires a beam of electricity.
Non-Automatic Weapons:Weapon now fires electrical projectiles.
Chest: Stuns melee attackers with electrical damage.

Mechanics[]
The augment effect is purely cosmetic and does not prime targets for electric detonations.
Automatic weapons continuously fire until the clip is depleted or the weapon is switched out.
When placed in non-automatic weapons, Electrical Conduits apparently ignores the weapon's base damage, effectively lowering its damage output.
Strategies[]
There are no benefits to use this augment on weapons, only drawbacks.  
Generally not worth it to augment armor, as melee engagements are either with enemies too weak to bother with or those that will just will kill you outright anyhow.
