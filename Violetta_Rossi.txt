Appearances
Mass Effect (cut)


Doctor Violetta Rossi is a character who was cut from Mass Effect during development. She oversaw one of the labs in the Throw Down refinery on the planet Caleston.
Violetta Rossi is implied to be rather young and fresh out of university. She seems to have been working for some time on Caleston though, as she appears to know Raciloma Amnoss rather well. She is first seen soon after Commander Shepard first comes to the refinery. On her way to work, Rossi is being sexually harrassed by Union workers who quickly turn to hurtful insults and threats. Nearby, Raciloma Amnoss notices it and steps in to defend her, and beats up the Union men while she hurries away.[1] Shepard may see her again in the labs, where she explains her job is to watch the centrifuges removing impurities from Element Zero. She however offers no help to get to Raciloma, since she claims she doesn't have a keycard to his office and only those working for him can get one.[2] Despite her apparent respect toward Raciloma, she doesn't comment on his death and seems ashamed to have been part of the Cartel's drug operation after it is taken down.[3]
