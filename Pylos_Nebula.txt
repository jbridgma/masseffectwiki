The Pylos Nebula lies deep in the Terminus Systems. It is mostly frontier with several races attempting to gain a substantial foothold and the usual pirates to harass them.
There are no known extant pre-spaceflight cultures in the cluster, although there are signs of pre-Citadel spacefaring civilizations in several locations.
