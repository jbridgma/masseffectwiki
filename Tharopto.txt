Description[]
Tharopto is a typical hydrogen-helium gas giant with traces of chlorine and sulphur in its atmosphere. It has over 100 moons and an extensive ring system composed of pulverized rock, presumably the debris from shattered moons.

Survey Text[]

“While scanning the planet Tharopto, you discovered a tiny moon with some odd readings. Further scans by Chief Engineer Adams revealed a destroyed escape pod. Your salvage team recovered the components and found a League of One medallion.”

Trivia[]
Tharopto's orbital distance of 29.4 AU appears to have been miscalculated. Judging by Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, the planet's orbital distance should actually be 23.6 AU, rather than the in-game value of 29.4 AU.
