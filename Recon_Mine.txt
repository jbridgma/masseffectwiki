Recon Mine is a power in Mass Effect 3's multiplayer mode. 

Power Ranks[]

Launch a mine that sticks to the first surface it touches and arms after 3 seconds. The mine scans the area for enemies to provide a tactical overlay, and it can be detonated at any time to deal massive damage to nearby targets.
Only one mine can be active at a time.

Player Notes[]
The mine's scan field takes 3 seconds to arm after coming into contact with a surface.
It cannot be detonated until after this scan field is active.
The scan field is omni-directional and is not limited to the red cone-shaped "laser field" visual effect of the scan.
Recon Mine has a significantly longer cooldown than many other powers. Thus, it is imperative that a Volus Engineer who frequently uses Recon Mine keep their weight as low as possible to reduce the cooldown. Only deploying the mine causes it to go on cooldown, detonating it does not; a new mine can be placed immediately after detonation.
Drell Assassin Infiltrators can significantly reduce Recon Mine's cooldown by deploying it while using Tactical Cloak (note that launching or detonating the mine will not break cloak), then attacking to break cloak, causing Tactical Cloak's shorter cooldown to override Recon Mine's.
For whatever reason, deploying Recon Mine after cloaking prevents deactivation of Tactical Cloak by recasting Tactical Cloak as is normally possible, unless the Bonus Power evolution of Cloak has been chosen, in which case deactivation counts as the extra power use. If you want to break cloak early, you will have to perform an attack in some way.
Keep in mind when detonating the Recon Mine that its explosive radius is smaller than its scan radius; enemies affected by the scan will not necessarily be damaged by the detonation.
Co-ordinating with squadmates allows the team to easily take out groups of tough enemies with Recon Mine. Have squadmates unload powers to tear away enemy protections and make enemies more vulnerable before detonating the Recon Mine. This strategy becomes even more deadly with the Rank 6 Invasive Scan evolution and/or the Rank 5 Damage Vulnerability evolution of Proximity Mine.
