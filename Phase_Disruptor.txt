Player Notes[]
Phase Disruptor fires a blast with pinpoint accuracy, hitting where you are aiming with an explosion. A maximum of 3 enemy targets can be hit.
This power functions somewhat similar to grenade powers in that it has no cooldown and is not disabled by Seeker Swarms. It is much like the Nova power in that it expends a portion of the personal barrier to fire, though unlike Nova, Phase Disruptor always inflicts full damage regardless of current barrier strength. It also cannot be used at all if barriers are below the required percentage.
This power does not lock onto enemies like most biotic or tech powers. However, it does damage in an area around its impact point, making it useful for firing at the ground to disrupt small enemy groups.
Charge makes a good complement to Phase Disruptor, especially with Charge's Rank 6 Barrier evolution. The player can fire Phase Disruptor once or twice to soften up a target, then Charge to recover barrier strength. Using Phase Disruptor is much less viable without a ready means to recover barriers. The reverse is also effective: Phase Disruptor can be used in between Charge attacks to buy a player time while the cooldown timer is running.
The Knockdown evolution of Phase Disruptor is surprisingly strong (much stronger than a Concussive Shot) and is more than capable of sending a vulnerable enemy flying. Phase Disruptor will only knock down one enemy per use, even if you hit multiple enemies.
Efficient Blast reduces the amount of barriers consumed by Phase Disruptor by 50%; as in instead of using 40% of your barrier, it will use 20% of your barrier per use. This also allows up to five uses without regenerating barriers, as opposed to only two.
Despite being powered by barriers, Phase Disruptor is not considered a true biotic power. Consequently, it will not prime or detonate biotic combos, but can detonate cryo, fire, and tech explosions. It also does not have its damage buffed by any multiplayer gear item except for the Mental Focuser.
Care should be used when using Phase Disruptor without being the host player because, as with Nova, Phase Disruptor does not impact immediately but rather about a second after pressing the button. This is further compounded by the fact that the Phase Disruptor blast itself will only affect and stagger enemies about one second from the time of impact.
