Prerequisite: A Trail of Hope

Govorkam is a system northeast of the Heleus Cluster's Black Hole. It is one FTL jump away from Solminae, Anasa, and Joba.
The system is named after a legendary krogan hero possibly because the nearby nebula resembled a krogan. Nakmor Drack disputes the hero assertion, however, calling Govorkam more like a "lucky idiot". Its worlds offer little by way of resources and has little else of note other than Kadara, a powerbase of exiles and pirates in the cluster.
