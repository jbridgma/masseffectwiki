The Ruins of Raashel's Home is a small region north of Pelaav Research Station. Formerly the abode of archaeoastronomer Raashel Vier, it was overrun and turned into a breeding ground by Havarl's native wildlife in her absence. It has dilapidated to the point plants have started growing on the structure.
Bounded by Remnant walls on three sides, the area technically consists only of the shack and a few meters' radius around it, with the rest given to Havarl's general territory. The outskirts below the walls has some nickel and platinum mineral nodes, on rocks and small caves.
Challyrions infest the location; on the outer edges are some groups of drall and the occasional big monster like an eiroch or rylkor. Even if the area is cleared of wildlife, they will repopulate the place later.
