Description[]
Although this hardsuit's basic materials-ceramic armor plating and kinetic padding-are Initiative standard, kett biotech permeates the overall design and feeds directly into the user's nervous system. Kett armor enhances combat prowess through chemical regulation and stimulation. This derivative armor can achieve the same result in conjunction with a SAM and Pathfinder implants.

At Ranks III & IV, the existing description changes to add the following text: "The upgraded suit is skintight and offers total control over the user's body temperature."
At Ranks V - X, the existing description changes to add the following text: "This upgraded suit adds exterior armor too heavy to wear without biotech enhancements."
Types[]
Ranks I - X are named Kett Fusion when the four armor pieces are crafted.
When the four armor pieces are found in-game:

Ranks I-II are named Kett Integrator.
Ranks III-IV are named Kett Fusion.
Ranks V-X are named Kett Unity.
Note:  There are no differences between the found versions compared to the crafted versions (other than visual).

Player Notes[]
 Features[]
Kett armor features the strongest support for Combat powers, with increased power damage and increased power cell capacity.

Strategies[]
Kett armor is arguably the best choice for Combat-based power specialists, due to the increased power damage and additional power cell capacity. The clear advantage of the armor is the ability to focus more shots on target with the main Combat skills: Concussive Shot, Flak Cannon, Omni-Grenade, and Trip-Mine. Each has an evolution track allowing for greater power cell capacity, which can further increase the number of shots the combat specialist can place on targets. Because these skills have evolutions devoid of cooldowns, players can freely load up on the heaviest weapons in the game.
As such, the armor synergizes best with the Solider profile, almost exclusively, because of the focus on aggressive weapon attacks and player durability. In this way, Kett armor supports the player as a mid-range 'artillery' and perimeter specialist that can pile on damage to hardened targets or clear the field of weaker enemies. The force of combat powers are also effective at knocking enemies out of cover for follow-up attacks with weapons fire. With careful planning and armor/weapon crafting, this durability can extend even further to reinforce shield regeneration and damage resistance. 
Unfortunately, these strengths have a trade off in the dynamics of player and squad combat; since combat powers lack priming and only have one detonator ability (Concussive Shot), players looking to create combo explosions will need to either cross-train (and equip a tech/biotic skill or specialized ammunition) or bring a squadmate with one, narrowing options down to Cora, Peebee, or Liam. 
Additionally, on harder difficulties with prolonged combat, players may find themselves limited to only two activities: laying down suppression fire while squadmates move around the battlefield or running for ammo crates. To offset this, consider pre-setting several Combat skill combinations among Ryder's favorites and 'switch' profiles in protracted engagements to bring up the next set. Since they will not need recharging, Ryder can switch to a new combat power without needing to run to another ammo crate; with this method, Ryder can deplete each power's ammunition before needing to reload and further take advantage of the armor's extra power cell bonus.
