Firebase Icebreaker is a map in Mass Effect: Andromeda's multiplayer mode. It is a fueling station on an ice planet.
Description[]
Outlaws built this facility to crack thick ice fields and obtain cheap fuel and ingredients for rare narcotics. Enemy factions want that factory up and running—the kett want its fuel, the outlaws want the profits, and more Remnant are reaching the surface through the cracked ice. The militia wants this facility shut down for good.
