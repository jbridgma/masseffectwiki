Description[]
This hardsuit is the ultimate product of Initiative research into Heleus Cluster species. Remnant power sources supply angaran hardware in a frame made possible by kett bio-enhancements and Pathfinder implants. This armor is unequivocally a combat suit, intended for the defense of Initiative and angaran colonies. You are its first and only user. All feedback is welcome.

At Ranks III & IV, the existing description changes to remove the last sentence and replaces it with the following text: "Additional upgrades further integrate all components into a cohesive whole."
At Ranks V - X, the existing description changes to remove the last sentence and replaces it with the following text: "This particular suit has been customized according to specific hazard data gathered from the Heleus Cluster."
Types[]
Ranks I - X are named Heleus Defender when the two armor pieces are crafted.
When the two armor pieces are found in-game:

Ranks I-II are named Heleus Defender.
Ranks III-IV are named Heleus Champion.
Ranks V-X are named Heleus Icon.
Note:  There are no differences between the found versions compared to the crafted versions (other than visual).

Features[]
Unlike any of the other armor sets Ryder can equip, the Heleus Armor does not specialize in enhancing a single combat style or character stat group. Its bonuses to damage reduction, weapon damage and all types of power damage turn it into a jack-of-all-stats armor that supports all play styles equally well without excelling in anything particular. It is the perfect choice for players who wish to make use of Ryder's full arsenal of skills without having to switch equipment all the time. 
The Heleus Armor is the only armor set in the game that requires all five faction-specific resources for crafting. It is also the most expensive armor to develop both in terms of resources and research points.

Strategies[]
The Heleus Armor's generalist nature gives the player much more freedom of choice in terms of augmentations during crafting, as the armor has no shortcomings that would need to be compensated. Players can therefore freely add extra functionalities of their choosing, enhance Ryder's survivability even further with shield- or health-boosting modules, or specialize their suit in those combat disciplines they think they will rely on the most, all without weakening the rest of their abilities in the process.
It should be noted that the armor consisting of only two parts instead of four severely cuts down on the number of augmentations that can be added in total. However, the Heleus Armor's accumulated inherent bonuses usually more than make up for this.
