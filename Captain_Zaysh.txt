Description[]
Prescyla is a terrestrial world so small, it cannot even retain a trace atmosphere. The surface is frozen and composed mostly of magnesium silicates with carbonaceous deposits.
In its recent past, a pirate gang from the Terminus Systems carved a message into the surface using ship-based laser weapons. In hundred-meter-wide batarian syllabic, the message proclaims the military prowess and virility of one "Captain Zaysh". A smaller postscript alludes to the questionable parentage of all humans.
