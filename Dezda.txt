Description[]
A dwarf planet, Dezda was explored in the beginnings of the batarian space age and mined for its unusual occurrences of uranium, which was rare on Khar'shan. Whether the planet has been completely mined out is unclear--accurate data on the planet was lost after a power struggle within the batarian government. The Reaper attack has further worsened the information flow.
