Sahrabarik has a developed infrastructure for supporting its main attraction, Omega, usually run by criminals for criminals. Imorkan is host to numerous refueling and layover stations, while the space around Urdak is often used to conduct intersyndicate warfare. The system is about 12 billion years old, and acts as a gateway system to other systems in the Omega Nebula.
In terms of extractable resources, only Bindur has a rich rating, particularly for platinum.
