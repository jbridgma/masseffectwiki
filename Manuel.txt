Manuel is Dr. Warren's assistant at the Eden Prime dig site and research station. 







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Dr. Warren claims he has always been unstable—"genius and madness are two sides of the same coin"—but since the geth attack, he has become almost completely unhinged, and Dr. Warren has been forced to medicate him.
Manuel blurts out comments that at the time make no sense to Commander Shepard or any of the rescue team; however, they prove to be an accurate foreshadowing of things to come. He is convinced that the age of humanity is over and there is absolutely no hope. When asked about Nihlus, Manuel claims he saw "the prophet" leading the enemy, but had in fact seen a different turian, Saren Arterius.
When Shepard asks Dr. Warren about Manuel's state of mind, the Commander has the opportunity to punch Manuel unconscious. 

Trivia[]
Chris Postle, who voices Manuel, also voices several other characters in the Mass Effect franchise: Jahleed, the Alliance Requisition Officer, and Corporal Toombs. Previously, he provided the voices for Shen and the Rat Demon in BioWare's Jade Empire.
Cut Content[]





The following information is drawn from cut content and is not to be considered canon in any way.

There is data hinting towards Shepard having had different interactions with Manuel during Prologue: Find the Beacon. You could offer to "help" him, or refuse to. A grenade is also mentioned, which could detonate or be disarmed. It was also possible, somehow, to "heal" Manuel.[1]
Unused audio in Mass Effect 2 would have shown that Firewalker scientist Dr. Manuel Cayce and Manuel are the same person.[2]
The first game's save data contains plot flags recording Shepard's behavior to Manuel (knocked out, had a civil chat, never met). However, these items are not imported to Mass Effect 2, which has unused audio of Manuel referencing what Shepard did.
