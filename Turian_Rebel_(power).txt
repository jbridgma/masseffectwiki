Player Notes[]
The Rank 6 Squad Bonus evolution applies to all members of the party including Garrus. There is possibility for confusion, as similarly named "Squad Bonus" evolutions on Shepard's various class powers do not apply to Shepard, only to NPC squadmates.
Despite the in-game wording not really specifying, the Rank 6 Squad Bonus evolution only applies to "combat" powers and not any tech or biotic powers. This includes Concussive Shot, Frag Grenade, Inferno Grenade, Proximity Mine, and Carnage. See the Powers (Mass Effect 3) page for a full list.
