Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Cryo Beam has no set range, meaning that any targeted enemy can be hit with the power.
Shielded enemies take damage from the beam, but cannot be frozen or primed for Cryo Combos.
Enemies need to be hit with the Cryo Beam for a few seconds before they are considered frozen. Unarmored and unshielded enemies will freeze solid and stop moving, while armored enemies will appear to be almost pure white and covered in ice.
Strategies
Due to its ability to both stop enemies and set them up for combos, Cryo Beam is especially useful against enemies such as Breachers, Adhi, and Wraiths that try to rush Ryder with melee attacks. Adding the Rank 5 Radius and Rank 6 Cryo Trap evolutions make it even more effective in this role.
Cryo Beam is one of the more effective powers for priming combos, as it has virtually unlimited range and if only used for a duration sufficient to freeze an enemy, has a very fast cool down.
