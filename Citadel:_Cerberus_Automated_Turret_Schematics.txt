Cerberus tech, the gift that keeps on givingAs always, all roads lead to the Citadel1/2
A C-Sec officer needs a way to detect or deactivate Cerberus turrets left behind on the Citadel. Find Cerberus automated turret schematics and bring them to him in the Presidium Commons.
Alternative journal entry:
Schematics for Cerberus automated turrets were recovered from Tuchanka. Find someone on the Citadel who can use them.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II

Prerequisite: Tuchanka: Bomb

Eavesdrop on the C-Sec Officer in the Presidium Commons after the attack on the Citadel. He is standing next to a volus on a balcony just outside of the vid-wall hallway, where two nurses discussing a traumatized asari used to perch before the attack. He mentions needing to deactivate Cerberus turrets that are threatening civilians.
Alternatively, the mission can be triggered by acquiring the Turret Control Schematics during the bomb defusal mission on Tuchanka.

Walkthrough[]
The C-Sec Officer is available only after the attack on the Citadel, although it is possible to obtain the schematics first. 


Retrieve the turret schematics from some crates where a couple of Assault Troopers are running away instead of facing you and a Combat Engineer sets up a turret. It's after the large open area where you and your squad get their first good look at the turian bomb. Take the schematics before meeting with Lt. Victus as the next area is a point of no return.
If you did not retrieve the schematics during the mission, you can purchase them at the Spectre Requisitions terminal in the Citadel Embassies for 1,000 credits.
When you hand over the schematics to the officer, you will be given 5 Reputation, 30 experience, and 1,000 credits. The Citadel Defense Force War Asset will be updated as well.
