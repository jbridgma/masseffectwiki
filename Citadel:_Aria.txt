The following information is drawn from cut content and is not to be considered canon in any way.

Citadel: Aria is an assignment  in Mass Effect which was cut during development. It was centered around an asari on the Citadel known as Aria with whom Shepard could have had many interactions.

Plotline[]
Once Commander Shepard has met Aria when she has a free moment, the two could discuss and reflect on major events throughout the game, such as Eden Prime, Noveria, Feros, and Caleston (as Therum was known at this point in development). Not only that, but Shepard could repeatedly "flirt" with Aria, and at one point, she would describe melding. The player could experience at least three different sessions with Aria, but it's unclear what would cause the assignment to reach completion.[1]

Trivia[]
Like other cut Citadel assignments, this Aria and her assignment bear more than a passing resemblance to Sha'ira the Consort and Citadel: Asari Consort.
