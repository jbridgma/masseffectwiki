Player Notes[]
Treat this power as an Ops Survival Pack with a cooldown. Use it when you or your nearby allies run low on shields.
This ability is crucial for any volus class, as it increases their survivability (considering volus have the lowest health/shield values of all races) and allows them to better support their allies.
The amount of shields restored by this power can be increased by choosing specific power upgrades from other powers available to player.
Power Damage increases at Ranks 1, 3, 4B, and 5A in Volus Training will increase the Initial Shield Boost but not Shields Per Second.
Choosing Rank 5B (Shield Boost) in Volus Training will increase the Initial Shield Boost and Shields Per Second.
If the player is looking to maximize Shield Boost, Rank 5B (Shield Boost) gives a bigger increase in Initial Shield Boost along with Shields Per Second versus Rank 5A (Power Damage).
Fitness power ranks that increase health and shield strength do not increase either Initial Shield Boost or Shields Per Second.
Although wholly a defensive power, activating Shield Boost will destroy Swarmers within its radius (without displaying a kill notification).
Shield Boost is especially effective during specific missions (such as escort and retrieval), as the volus can stick to the other player(s) and restore their shields.
Using Shield Boost right after reviving a teammate is a good strategy, as resurrected players will have no shield.
Shield Boost also gives a brief second or two of invulnerability. This will prevent you AND your team from dying from an otherwise fatal injury, and when used with Biotic Orbs and a low enough cooldown, it makes it nearly impossible to down a volus.
When used with the right timing, Shield Boost can prevent either the user or nearby allies from being executed by sync kills from enemies such as Phantoms and Banshees as long as the character is under the invulnerability effect when hit by the "killing blow" part of the animation (e.g. a Phantom's sword stab). The character will still go through the animations of getting "killed," but will recover with full shields afterwards as if nothing happened. The timing is fairly strict with a very small window of opportunity, and it can easily be misjudged due to lag.
This trick can also be self-executed with Ops Survival Packs but only against Phantom and Brute sync kills as they are the only ones fast enough to execute before the invulnerability from using a pack wears off.
