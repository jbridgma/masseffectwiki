Description[]
Named after a northern Irunian luck deity, Cherk Sab is overshadowed by the economy on Locil and the scientific research on Doldit. The solar system's "middle child," Cherk Sab now has the only functioning helium-3 fuel apparatus in the system, as the Reapers have not yet struck there. The space around it is jammed with volus ships trying to flee the system.
