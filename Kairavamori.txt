Kairavamori is a dimming orange star. Its three terrestrial worlds all rate rich in resources, particularly iridium.
Batarians, pirates, and mercenary companies have staked claims on much of the system for mining or just territory. However, few dare to explore Sehtor's resources or settle there because of its volatile landscape.
