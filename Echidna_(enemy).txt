The echidna is a wildlife unit. It can be found on Voeld and Elaaden. It is similar in build and classification to the rylkor, although it has a more insectoid appearance. It does not appear to have any visible eyes.
As with several large creatures, upon death the echidna disintegrates instead of leaving a corpse to identify. The only way to scan it is to carefully approach it when the animal is unaware.
