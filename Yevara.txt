Yevara are a subterranean species found on Voeld. These creatures are an important part of angaran folklore.
The yevara can be seen "swimming" beneath frozen bodies of water. Judging by their profiles, these large creatures have  serpentine bodies with numerous trailing appendages and move by undulating. Bioluminescent markings help distinguish their bulk from their surroundings. Their general behavior pattern and characteristics appear to be analogous to whales'.
The yevara are able to communicate through intricate songs. The angara have static recordings of their songs, though in the wild they can often be heard "singing" as they swim along.
Planetary changes caused by the Scourge trapped the yevara beneath a thick layer of ice. Angaran biologists are studying how they survive but have yet to find an answer. The yevara are cut off from food and oxygen but they still persist. A biologist even theorizes that yevara are Remnant. 
The angara have old folktales about the creatures. The stories about the yevara are the only ones that survived the Scourge and most of them have the same theme: "A yevara's song is so beautiful, it can coax out the sun out of hiding, reveal the stars."
Reports of Exiles poaching the yevara can be brought to Pathfinder Ryder's attention. It's later revealed that the Exiles were merely Dr. Lekaaret's hired help, an angaran scientist who has been attempting to use the creatures in her effort to help the Resistance's war on Voeld. If confronted by the Pathfinder, the scientist can be allowed to keep studying the yevara, or persuaded to stop the poaching.
