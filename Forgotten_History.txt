Walkthrough[]
Search Voeld for an angaran relic[]
The Ancient Angaran Figurine is located underground  in the frozen city of Ja Niihk Dig Site on Voeld, in a small room behind some crates. The site can't be accessed until Remove the Heart has been completed. BEFORE picking up the Figurine, scan the Figurine for +10 .
Note: This portion of the mission can be completed at the same time as Uncovering the Past because that mission targets the same location.

Search Kadara for an angaran relic[]
Go to Kurinth's Valley on Kadara and head to the northwest on the top of very high location. At the navpoint, Ryder will find the  Ancient Angaran Musical Instrument. BEFORE picking up the Instrument, scan the Instrument for +10 . 

Search Elaaden for an angaran relic[]
Go to the Sea of Ataraxia on Elaaden and go to the very northwest of the map. At the navpoint on, Ryder will find the Ancient Angaran Star Map. BEFORE picking up the Map, scan the Map for +10 . 
Note:  The third artifact retrieval does not appear in the journal, nor do you get a notification about it, until the mission Elaaden: A New World is triggered and Ryder actually lands on Elaaden itself.

Return the found angaran relics to Avela on Aya[]
The relics can be returned to Avela at any time for +270 XP each. The recovered items will be displayed at the Repository of History.
The Ancient Angaran Star Map, it turns out, is a log of someone's traveling but the log is encrypted. Avela promises to inform you if anything is discovered.
