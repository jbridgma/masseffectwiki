An asari consultant on the Citadel needs the Rings of Alune. Find them in the Silean Nebula and return them to her at the Huerta Memorial Hospital.
Alternative journal entry:
The Rings of Alune, an asari artifact, were recovered from the Silean Nebula. Find someone on the Citadel who can use them.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II

Prerequisite: Priority: Rannoch

Listen to an asari consultant's comm conversation with a salarian standing on the right when you exit the hospital elevator. She's with a human assistant, overseeing a trio of patients on the floor (human male, salarian, and either a human female or an asari in armor).
Alternatively, a Search and Rescue operation in the Silean Nebula will yield the artifact and this mission's journal entry. In this case it is labeled Citadel: Rings of Alune.

Walkthrough[]

The Teyolia system only becomes available after Priority: Rannoch. That is a gap of at least 4 Priority missions from earliest mission acquisition to mission completion. Scan planet Nevos in the Teyolia system and return the artifact to the asari at the Huerta Memorial Hospital. She needs it to declare a "cultural crisis" and get more asari support for the hospitals.
After handing the artifact to her, you'll gain 5 Reputation, 15,000 credits and the Citadel Defense Force War Asset will be updated.
