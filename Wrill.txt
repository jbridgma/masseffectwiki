Description[]
A planet only a vorcha could love, Wrill is notable for its "near miss" climate: punishing heat and a thin toxic methane-ethane atmosphere. Its surface is dotted with krogan and vorcha habitats eking out a meager living off the planet's tin and copper deposits and killing anyone who cuts into their profits.
TRAVEL ADVISORY: Krogan can survive in the heat with the use of a breathing mask. All other species require environmental suits to avoid heat exhaustion and burns. Liquid water can be found in large lakes on the surface. This can be used for thermoregulation, but it is not potable without processing.
ALLIANCE BULLETIN: Large-scale gang warfare is a regular occurrence on Wrill. Civilian traffic is not advised.
