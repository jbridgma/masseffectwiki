The Krogan Commander is the commander of Saren's troops on Feros.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




The Krogan Commander is in charge of destroying the Thorian after Saren had obtained the information on the Cipher. The Krogan Commander is attempting to access restricted files from the ExoGeni VI, and getting frustrated in the process, when he is ambushed by Shepard and the squad during their investigation into geth activities.

Tactics[]
The Krogan Commander is armed with a shotgun only, and given where he is, it works well for him. Because of the confined area, using biotics and just pumping lead into him will work.
Lift can be useful, especially when Throw is used right afterward to send him flying down the stairs.
Like all krogan, if he is not killed in the air, or by ammunition/grenades that destroy the target upon killing them (like incendiary, toxic, or high explosive), then he will regenerate once before dying.
