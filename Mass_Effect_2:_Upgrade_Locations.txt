This Upgrade Guide lists the locations and prices[1] for all equipment and power upgrades available in Mass Effect 2. Upgrades are listed by their locations and equipment type or biotic/tech, with purchase prices given as before possible discounts where applicable. When starting a new play-through with a Shepard that beat the game, your upgrades from that previous file won't carry over.
The amount of credits available from a normal play-through covering all missions, assignments and current DLC is 1,280,251[2] with a theoretical maximum of 1,347,951 if avoiding the use of medi-gel and heavy weapons and choosing Renegade options for credits. Acquiring all upgrades no longer requires importing a level 60 (+50,000) character with the "Rich" achievement (+100,000) or starting with the completion bonus (+200,000) from Mass Effect 2 as long as all the DLC is installed, otherwise these import standards are necessary. 
Note:  See Credits by Location for tips on generating more income.
Note that research costs depend on the number of upgrades researched so far. So the cost for the first Heavy Pistol Damage upgrade will always be 2,500 Palladium, regardless of where it is acquired, followed by 5,000 and 7,500 for the next two tiers. Acquiring an upgrade from a store does not change the cost of the research upgrades. You can also get up to a 25% discount on all research projects by being an Engineer; furthermore, after completing the game with a single character all subsequent playthroughs will be granted +50,000 of each resource for free. 
Total resources needed to research/buy all useful upgrades:

195,500 palladium (237,500 for all upgrades from DLC)
275,000 platinum (305,000 for all upgrades from DLC)
200,000 iridium (242,500 for all upgrades from DLC)
31,000 element zero (35,000 for all upgrades from DLC; +5,000 for each Advanced Training and +2,500 for each Retrain Powers)
1,253,416 credits (including discounts, this includes all maps, and items which either lead to more credits or which lead to other upgrades)
Legendary Edition:  All previous DLC for the original version of Mass Effect 2 is included by default. In the original game, most of the weapons or other items included with DLC packs becomes available automatically in the game at no additional in-game cost. In Legendary Edition, most of the equipment that is "DLC exclusive" in the original game must instead be purchased with additional credits at vendors or with mineral resources in the Normandy's Tech Lab just like everything else. For this reason, much of the above information may not be applicable.

Credits by Location/Mission[]
This is a list of how many credits are attainable and what missions they are on. Credits that are optional are listed separately from the totals. Power cells and med kits are listed because you can get 100 credits from each of them if you are full, but they are not included in the totals.
These numbers show that if you maximize your credits (and have all the appropriate DLC) you will still fall a few thousand short of purchasing all upgrades, not including trinkets. That's also not taking into account the several thousand you will probably need to spend on probes and fuel. So starting bonuses from prior playthroughs are necessary to get all upgrades.

If the Normandy SR-2 possesses the Extended Fuel Cells or Modular Probe Bay upgrades after you complete the game, and the ship currently holds 1500/1500 fuel and 60/60 probes import this Mass Effect 2 save into a new game. The Normandy SR-2 will possess 1500/1000 fuel and 60/30 probes following the Freedom's Progress Mission. However the probes may revert to 30/30 once a single probe has been fired (only giving you one free probe), the extra 500 fuel will still be burnt off before your actual reserves are drained regardless.
It is sometimes possible to bypass a safe, datapad, or container more than once (doesn't work 100% of the time without tedious reloads), doubling or even tripling the credits received from that particular object. Rapidly press A (Green) on the Xbox 360 or Use (Spacebar) on the PC after the minigame screens flash green to accomplish this (upon finishing the final circuit, or final line of hack code).
Acquiring Urz and betting on him in the pit battles at Tuchanka (save before each match) can also provide an unlimited stream of credits due to his high win probability, although this method is tedious at best.
