Player Notes[]
Grenade powers do not have a recharge time and, thus, can be used immediately at any time, provided grenades are available. Using the power consumes one grenade each time.
If the player has multiple grenade powers, the grenade pool is shared between them.
The number of blades for this power is dictated by the grenade supply available to the player.
Nightshade Blades hits all enemies in a fairly large cone-shaped area in front of the player.
Nightshade Blades is one of the most damaging powers in the game even without taking the considerable damage-over-time into account. The initial damage dealt is more severe at very close range; the power can be thought of like a shotgun blast that fires pellets.
Nightshade Blades has no ability to set up or trigger Power Combos.
This power benefits from equipping Gear items that increase the number of grenades that a player can carry. Equipping a gear item that will increase grenade capacity will boost the number of charges for this power.
Exploding Blades does not end the damage-over-time effect that Nightshade Blades places on a target.
Paralysis: The paralysis effect of Nightshade Blades is unique to it and the rank 6 Poison Strength evolution of Poison Strike.
It works like a freeze, turning the affected target into a "statue" for the duration.
Despite the wording of the in-game text, only ONE target maximum can be paralyzed per cast of Nightshade Blades; all other targets in range are merely staggered. Unprotected targets are staggered more severely than protected ones. The effect prioritizes the closest target hit—if that target can't be paralyzed, then NO target is paralyzed.
Only unprotected targets (red bar) infantry targets can be paralyzed; this works on synthetic targets as well as Phantoms.
Only the initial hit of Nightshade Blades can cause paralysis; if a shielded target's protection breaks due to the poison damage-over-time, it will still not become paralyzed.

Single-player: N/A

Trivia[]
The name "Nightshade Blades" is likely referencing the highly toxic herb Atropa belladonna, commonly known as deadly nightshade, which has a long history of use as a poison.
