Description[]
A boiling hot rock planet with extreme tectonic activity, Parnassus is home to many volcanic mountains. Surface scans reveal several geothermal and solar power stations, tapping the planet's abundant energy. There is no history of the planet or its government in Citadel Council records. Given its proximity to a mapped and recorded planet like Cyllene, someone must have deleted Parnassus from the database.

Trivia[]
The planet may be named for Mount Parnassus, a mountain in central Greece upon which the city of Delphi was located, Delphi being best known as the site of the Oracle of Delphi.
The planet is possibly a reference to the planet Kamino from Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. The planet's existence was deleted from the galactic database in the movie.
