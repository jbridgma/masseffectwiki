The kirik are a species of biotic-capable beetle-like insectoids native to the arid world of Ekram. The kirik were considered an exciting discovery initially because they were the first known insects able to control biotics; previously, it was thought insects and other arthropod-like creatures lacked the complex neural pathways necessary to develop biotic powers.
After further study, however, the kirik were also found to exhibit some signs of rudimentary intelligence. The lead biologist of the team studying the kirik went so far as to assert that the creatures were ideal candidates for "uplifting", sparking a contentious debate across the galaxy about the possible dangers and ethics of such an action. In December of 2185, the Citadel Council dispatched representatives to evaluate the kiriks' intelligence and compare it to standard galactic sapience tests.
