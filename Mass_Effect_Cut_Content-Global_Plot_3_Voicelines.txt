Elarya
Commander Shepard

Elarya: Thank you for coming to see me, Spectre.

(Neu) Goodbye. (Inv) I'm listening.  Shepard: I should get going.Elarya: I see. Well... Should you change your mind, seek me out. Good day.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Elarya:"Spectre, perhaps you'll have a moment to hear my request now?
(Neu) No. (Inv) Sure.  Shepard: Not now.Elarya: Alright, but should you change your mind, please come find me.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Elarya: Spectre, perhaps you'll have a moment to hear my request now?(Return to last choice) Shepard: I'll hear your request.Elarya: Very good. One of our most respected scientists has disappeared in a remote area of the Attican Traverse. We believe they may have been attacked. Shepard: What do you need?Elarya: One of our most respected scientists has disappeared in a remote area of the Attican Traverse. We believe they may have been attacked.
(Par) What about protection? (Neu) That's intriguing. (Ren) Nice job.  Shepard: Didn't you have a security escort?Elarya: We have no knowledge of anything in that region that could pose a serious risk to our ships. The doctor was on her way to receive a decoration for helping rid a remote hanar colony of a deadly virus. The hanar claim to have no knowledge of her whereabouts, even though she disappeared within their space. Shepard: Who would have attacked an asari doctor?Elarya: We have no knowledge of anything in that region that could pose a serious risk to our ships. The doctor was on her way to receive a decoration for helping rid a remote hanar colony of a deadly virus. The hanar claim to have no knowledge of her whereabouts, even though she disappeared within their space. Shepard: Maybe you shouldn't have sent her to a remote region of space unprotected.Elarya: I suppose now, it doesn't seem like such a good idea. At the time however, it looked to be a safe enough journey. The doctor was on her way to receive a decoration for helping rid a remote hanar colony of a deadly virus. The hanar claim to have no knowledge of her whereabouts, even though she disappeared within their space.
(Par) Don't worry, I'm on it. (Neu) I can help. (Ren) Sorry, no. (Inv) Investigate  Shepard: I'll let you know as soon as I find anything.Elarya: Thank you, Spectre. I'll send her last known coordinates to your ship. Good favor to you in your search, Spectre.(End of conversation) Shepard: I'll see what I can do to find your doctor.Elarya: Thank you, Spectre. I'll send her last known coordinates to your ship. Good favor to you in your search, Spectre.(End of conversation) Shepard: I'm just not interested right now.Elarya: Come back and see me if you change your mind, Spectre.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Elarya: Spectre, have you decided to help me locate Doctor Euthalia?
(Par) Don't worry, I'm on it. (Neu) I can help. (Ren) Not right now. (Inv) Investigate  Shepard: I'll let you know as soon as I find anything.Elarya: Thank you, Spectre. I'll send her last known coordinates to your ship. Good favor to you in your search, Spectre.(End of conversation) Shepard: I'll see what I can do to find your doctor.Elarya: Thank you, Spectre. I'll send her last known coordinates to your ship. Good favor to you in your search, Spectre.(End of conversation) Shepard: I said no. Goodbye.Elarya: Good day, Spectre.(End of conversation)(Re-intiating conversation)Elarya: Spectre, have you decided to help me locate Doctor Euthalia?"(Return to last choice)
(Inv) Hanar's secrecy (Inv) Doctor Euthalia (Inv) Crash location (Inv) Euthalia's destination  Shepard: If they know something, wouldn't it be in their best interest to tell you?Elarya: You would think so, but... something tells me there's more to this than they're letting on. The hanar are sensitive about intrusions into their space.(Return to last choice) Shepard: What makes this one doctor so important you'd send a Spectre to rescue her?Elarya: We're not the same as you humans. When one of our elder members dies before her time, she takes with her a great deal of experience and knowledge. Doctor Euthalia is not only one of the foremost asari scientists, she's one of the brightest and most notable experts in all of Citadel space. Then there's the issue of a possible hostile act being perpetrated against an asari. If that is, or happened, we need to plan for the appropriate... reaction.
(P Inv) The asari could do it.  Shepard: Why not look for the doctor yourself?Elarya: There's no sense sending in a fleet when one person can get the job done. You and I both know the doctor's chances of survival are slim at best. You're her best chance right now.(Return to over-arching choice) Shepard: Do you know anything more about the planet where the doctor's ship went down?Elarya: There's only a minimal atmosphere, and the weather systems can be extremely dangerous. There are no lifeforms known to inhabit the planet, but... I would go prepared to meet just about anything.(Return to last choice) Shepard: Tell me what you know about the hanar colony Doctor Euthalia was travelling to.Elarya: From what we've learned, they're much like any other hanar colony. If anything, they may be more xenophobic than most hanar. That was one of the reasons we agreed to send Doctor Euthalia. We thought it would be an excellent opportunity for her to learn more about such a remote colony.(Return to last choice)

Tali'Zorah nar Rayya (missing)

Hanar senator: Commander. Is there anything this one can do to aid your mission?

(Unknown 1) (Unknown 2) (Unknown 3)  (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: No, not physically. But there are worse things than pain. They want the doctor to assist them in the creation of a weapon. (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: Indeed. Though I'm afraid it is worse still. They want the doctor to assist them in the creation of a weapon. (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: They've taken the doctor. They want the doctor to assist them in the creation of a weapon.
(Wrex is not present) (Wrex is present)  | Kaidan Alenko: What kind of weapon?| Ashley Williams: Weapon? How can the doctor help them with that?Hanar senator: They are making another bioweapon. Worse than the last one they inflicted upon us. Urdnot Wrex: You're talking about bioweapons.Hanar senator: Yes, you speak correctly. And they wish to create one even greater than the last that they inflicted upon us.
(Unknown 1) (Unknown 2)  (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: It is saddened to say so. And if they gain the doctor's aid, we may not survive the next attempt. This one is ashamed to say... we are at war with our lystheni neighbors. (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: Resources. The lystheni have laid claim to the asteroids nearby. We've tried diplomacy, but they repay us with attacks on our colonies. This one is ashamed to say... we are at war with our lystheni neighbors.
(Missing Shepard interjection)
Hanar senator: A remote asteroid facility. This one has uploaded the coordinates to your ship. Please bring her back, Commander. It is our fault she is in this danger.

(Unknown 1) (Unknown 2) (Inv) Investigate  (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: Good, good. This one is pleased to hear you say so.(End of conversation) (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: The lystheni will force her to help them. You must stop them, Commander.(End of conversation)
(Inv) Lystheni facility Bioweapon Lystheni  (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: Details are sparse. We only recently learned of its existence. All attempts to infiltrate the facility have failed. We believe it is used primarily to carry out experiments that the lystheni government has not officially sanctioned. The main bunker is located underground on an asteroid. It will be difficult to gain entrance undetected, Commander.(Return to last choice) (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: Our scientists are speculating even now, but we have no actual data yet. We do know the lystheni have done this before. They infiltrate our colonies using small, undetectable vessels, getting just close enough to release deadly agents onto our unsuspecting population. How the virus or viral agent will work, we do not know. We have no defense, and millions could die before we develop a cure.(Return to last choice) (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: They are biologically similar to salarians, but different in culture, language and ideology. Lystheni means "the old blood" in their tongue. They separated from their kin centuries ago during the formation of the Citadel Council. Their language and their cousins' language have evolved... differently. Of particular note is their dislike of the Citadel Council and everything it stands for. The lystheni vehemently oppose all Council edicts, often to their own detriment. Of course it means they don't abide by any of the Citadel laws either. It makes them a very dangerous enemy.
(P Inv) (Unknown 1) (R Inv) (Unknown 2)  (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: The lystheni have harvested minerals from the asteroids in our region for generations. Only recently have we allowed others to do so as well. The lystheni believed the asteroids were theirs. They began to refuse access to others and aggressively defended the asteroids. That was almost a full generation ago. The conflict has been escalating ever since.(Return to last choice) (Missing Shepard interjection)Hanar senator: The Council considers this to be a civil dispute and refuses to interfere. It is partly due to our remote location, but also due to the fact that the hanar people harbored the lystheni in the first place. The lystheni will still expect someone to come for the doctor, but they know the Council will not change their non-interference stance for one asari.(Return to last choice)

Shepard: Yes, but unfortunately I haven't located the doctor yet.Elarya: Please hurry, Doctor Euthalia's life may well hang in the balance.(End of conversation) Shepard: I need to go.Elarya: Please hurry, Doctor Euthalia's life may well hang in the balance.(End of conversation) Shepard: I was just on my way there.Elarya: Please hurry, Doctor Euthalia's life may well hang in the balance.(End of conversation)

Nuriam: These poor lystheni...

(Unknown 1) (Unknown 2)  (Missing Shepard interjection)Nuriam: They have no choice! The hanar have evoked martial law on lystheni colonies. The lysthenis are prisoners in their own homes! (Missing Shepard interjection)Nuriam: It's not their fault! Not entirely. The hanar have evoked martial law on lystheni colonies. The lysthenis are prisoners in their own homes!
(Unknown 1) (Unknown 2) (Unknown 3)  (Missing Shepard interjection)Nuriam: I'm not surprised. The hanar don't want outside intervention. The hanar outnumber the lystheni ten to one, and they use that advantage to force the lystheni to conform to their rules and laws. (Missing Shepard interjection)Nuriam: No. I've seen evidence of the hanar's actions. They're treating the lystheni horribly! The hanar outnumber the lystheni ten to one, and they use that advantage to force the lystheni to conform to their rules and laws. (Missing Shepard interjection)Nuriam: And what lengths would you humans go to if a species had threatened to make you slaves? The hanar outnumber the lystheni ten to one, and they use that advantage to force the lystheni to conform to their rules and laws.
(Unknown 1) (Unknown 2)  (Missing Shepard interjection)Nuriam: I don't think it was always that way but... there's some sort of dispute, over resources. Instead of working out some sort of deal, the hanar just clamped down on the lystheni. The lystheni are worried that Council intervention could be even more intrusive than what the hanar are doing to them. They're certainly making things more difficult for themselves than they need to. (Missing Shepard interjection)Nuriam: I won't try to convince you. But I know what I've seen. Instead of working out some sort of deal, the hanar just clamped down on the lystheni.

(Missing Euthalia or Shepard interjection)
| Urdnot Wrex: I found a way to stop the transmission, but it involves blowing up the facility.
| Kaidan Alenko: Commander. I can't stop the transmission, not directly. But I can shut down the remaining systems and destroy the entire facility, transmitters and all.
| Ashley Williams: Commander. If I shut down the core systems, I can cause a chain reaction that would destroy the entire facility, including the transmitters.
(Missing Euthalia interjection)
| Kaidan Alenko: It's not her fault. Most of the data is already in the transmitter buffers, and the only way to stop it is to destroy the transmitters.
| Ashley Williams: There's nothing she could do, everything's been transfered to the buffers. The only way to stop it is to destroy the transmitters themselves.
| Urdnot Wrex: There's nothing you can do here, the data is already in the transmitter buffers. You'll need to destroy the transmitters if you want the data stopped.

(Par) She's been through a lot. (Neu) Just doing my job. (Ren) Now, my credits.  Shepard: The lystheni were less than kind to her.Elarya: So I've heard. You risked much in rescuing Doctor Euthalia, and I've made sure you'll be rewarded for it. I've transferred the credits to your account. Thank you again, Spectre. Knowing the doctor is safe again is a great relief. Shepard: I did what I had to.Elarya: I see. Well, I suppose you'll be expecting your payment. I've transferred the credits to your account. Thank you again, Spectre. Knowing the doctor is safe again is a great relief. Shepard: I expect to be well paid for this.Elarya: You will be, don't worry. I've transferred the credits to your account. Thank you again, Spectre. Knowing the doctor is safe again is a great relief. Elarya: Spectre, the hanar senator said you'd be along.

I've transferred the credits to your account. Thank you again, Spectre. Knowing the doctor is safe again is a great relief. Elarya: Spectre. It seems you've been busy, not just rescuing the doctor but helping to straighten up the conflict between the lystheni and the hanar. The Council was not impressed with the hanar's actions, but it seems a peaceful outcome's almost certain now. It's a good thing you intervened. We likely never would have heard about the conflict otherwise.
(Par) That's good to hear. (Neu) The war had to end. (Ren) Faulty intel.  Shepard: I'm glad to hear they were able to come to an amicable understanding.Elarya: Here, Spectre. Credits for your trouble. And a little extra for... getting the peace process started.

Credits for your trouble. And a little extra for... getting the peace process started.
