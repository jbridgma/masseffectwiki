Sol is the home system of the humans and the Systems Alliance. 
Most of the planets in Sol can be mined by the Normandy SR-2, with the exception of Earth and Mars. However, none of the planets have beyond a Good rating for minerals.
The system was previously cut off from the galactic relay network due to the Charon Relay being encased in ice. The Prothean Empire used to have an outpost on Mars and research interests on the primitive inhabitants of Earth during their heyday 50,000 years ago.

Trivia[]
Note that Pluto appears on the system chart and is considered a planet for game purposes. Charon is not on the star map, but is included here for background.
In Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, Sol is one of the largest star systems, having 9 planets while most other systems have 4 or 5 planets.
The Solar System contains two distinct debris rings: the Asteroid Belt and the Kuiper Belt. However only the Asteroid Belt is shown within the game. This may be due to the fact that Pluto lies within the Kuiper Belt.
The positions of the planets in Mass Effect 2 suggest that the game takes place on 01/26/2185; 175 years after the North American release date of the game, 01/26/2010.
