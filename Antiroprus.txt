Description[]
Antiroprus is a hydrogen-helium gas giant that formed in the outer regions of Ming's system, and is in the process of migrating inwards. In a few million years, the planet's atmosphere will begin to "boil away" into space.
There is a sizable temperature difference between the side of Antiroprus facing the energetic blue giant primary and the side facing the cold of deep space. This variance powers massive cyclonic wind systems. The intense heat it absorbs from the sun, in addition to its own internal heat engine, causes the planet's dark side to radiate faintly in the infrared.

Properties[]
Antiroprus has already lost too much atmosphere to be classed as a "hydrogen-helium gas giant" anymore (William Hubbard, The New Solar System 4th ed, 1999; p. 194). It is now an "ice giant" like Neptune or Gliese 436 b. Ming will go supernova before Antiroprus loses its ice layer.
