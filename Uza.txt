Description[]
Uza is a methane-rich gas giant. The wreckage around the helium-3 infrastructure is unusual--it looks as if fleeing batarians tried to sever the collection equipment and take it with them when they were attacked. No Reaper ships, functional or otherwise, are immediately detectable, suggesting that the batarians may have actually turned on each other.
