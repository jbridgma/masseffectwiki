Helena Blake is a co-leader of a crime syndicate who persuades Commander Shepard to deal with her other two associates. If Shepard follows through, Blake can be found on Amaranthine and congratulates the Spectre for a job well-done. If Shepard insists on arresting her instead of letting her be or convincing her to walk away from crime, Blake becomes belligerent and orders her minions to eliminate Shepard, also joining the fray as a biotic. She doesn't survive the encounter.

Tactics[]
Helena Blake possesses 3 bars of shielding, which can recover over time. Like many other biotics in the game, her health doesn't regenerate but she can use Barrier to increase her shielding to six bars.
She is armed with a pistol and an assault rifle, primarily using the pistol. However, even if she is Sabotaged she never switches to her backup weapon.
Being a biotic, she can also use Warp to increase your vulnerability to damage and Lift you and squadmates, allowing for several seconds of unhampered shooting. Legendary Edition:  She no longer uses Lift against Shepard, only against squadmates.
Damping will be very useful for this fight, preventing her from using biotics. You might also consider using Stasis to isolate her from the fight while you deal with the mercenaries.
Because she's the only biotic in the room, specialised anti-biotic equipment like Shock Absorbers or Radioactive Rounds are unnecessary. Instead, more common equipment like Medical Interfaces or Incendiary Rounds are recommended to provide health regeneration, reduce enemy accuracy and increase the weapons' damage.
