Description[]
A deadly kett submachine gun with plasma-surrounded projectiles. The Rozerad's firing rate increases with every shot. Although clearly designed for kett, the Rozerad, translated to "infinite fire," appears to incorporate technology from another species - perhaps an ally or kett vassal.

Features[]
The Rozerad is essentially the kett version of the Geth Plasma SMG from Mass Effect 3. It is lightweight and fairly weak in terms of per-shot damage, but its rate of fire increases rapidly as the trigger is held down. Its damage output is stymied by its clip size, its ravenous ammo consumption and the fact that in order to make use of its most distinctive feature, its wielders have to expose themselves to enemy fire for prolonged periods of time. 
A Pistol Magazine mod can enable the Rozad to deal an astounding amount of damage quickly, but it cannot change the fact that it is one of the most dangerous weapons to use against enemies that shoot back.
The multiplayer Rozerad gained improvements to accuracy, tight aim accuracy, rate of fire and rate of fire change during balance change updates.

Strategies[]
SingleplayerMultiplayer
Singleplayer
Deploying the Rozerad against humanoid enemies with guns is a dangerous proposition because Ryder is liable to take a lot of enemy fire while peeking out of cover. This makes the Rozerad most effective against animals and enemies with a silhouette large enough to provide a good target at ranges where they will either not shoot or not hit Ryder. The latter mostly comes down to Hydra Mechs and the occasional Ascendant
The Rozerad lends itself to laying down suppressive fire, as well as stripping shields from multiple enemies at long range when loaded with Disruptor Ammo. In a similar vein it can be used to quickly prime numerous targets for combo detonations by setting them aflame or freezing them with Incendiary Ammo or Cryo ammo, respectively.
