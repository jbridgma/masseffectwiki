Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Red holographic circles arranged in a cylinder enclose the barrel of the weapon on Turbocharge activation then disappears again upon reaching cooldown phase.
Turbocharge is active throughout its given duration even while not firing weapons.
Recharge time applies only after the duration of the skill, not while Turbocharge is still active. At Rank 1, this means 8 seconds of continuous fire followed by 20 seconds of cooldown (15 with Vetra).
At Rank 4 for Pathfinder Ryder and multiplayer characters, picking Recharge Speed amounts to 8 seconds duration and 15 seconds recharge speed while picking Duration amounts to 12 seconds duration and 18 seconds recharge speed. For Vetra, Recharge Speed amounts to 8 seconds duration and 11 seconds recharge speed while Duration amounts to 12 seconds duration and 15 seconds recharge speed.
Strategies
Combines well with the Beam Emitter augmentation and the Soldier Profile for an even more destructive approach to armored targets.
Turbocharge has limited utility with single-shot or semiautomatic weapons due to being optimized for automatics. It can provide the former two with increased clip size and damage, but they won't benefit much from the increased firing rate unless playing with an unusually twitchy trigger finger.
This skill pairs well with unstable weapons with very large clips, reserve ammo, and firing rate like the Cyclone and Soned.
Turbocharge is ideally to be used when facing clumps of enemies. Using it to dispatch single non-heavy targets isn't advisable if there's a high chance of running into more enemies shortly afterward given the lengthy recharge time even when upgraded.
