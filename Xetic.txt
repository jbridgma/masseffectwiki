Description[]
A common methane-ammonia gas giant, Xetic is best known for the infamous Kal'thor Camp. Established on the ice moon of Gesis, Kal'thor was a Blue Suns hostile environment training facility, run by a cadre of former batarian Special Intervention Unit operators. In 2168, a cluster-wide scandal broke out when it was revealed that the mortality rate of recruits sent to the camp might be as high as 18%.
Investigation by asari authorities based on Illium uncovered group graves around the facility containing the remains of several hundred recruits, dating back two decades. The camp was immediately closed, and the remains sent back to their worlds of origin. An inquest by the Blue Suns found the batarian commandos had used harsh training methods, but these were consistent with their own training to join the SIU. The batarians were exonerated, though Kal'thor was shut down, and they were reassigned to other units. As the Crescent Nebula is beyond the sphere of Council law, no civil charges could be filed against the Blue Suns.
