Solminae is a system northeast of the Heleus Cluster's Black Hole. It is one FTL jump away from Govorkam.
Lighted by an aging star, the angara tried and failed to colonize the system. It has untapped and inaccessible resources.
On first visit to Solminae, Suvi notes that they're getting more and more data on the Scourge. She wonders if it's a local phenomenon or if it encompasses the entire galaxy.
