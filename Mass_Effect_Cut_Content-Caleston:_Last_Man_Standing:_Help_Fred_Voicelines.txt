Oronath: This one begs your forgiveness for the unprofessional equipment. How can this one help you?

(Par) I'd like medical aid. (Neu) Goodbye. (R Inv) Debt money (Inv) Investigate  Shepard: We need your services.Oronath: This one apologizes fervently for the lack of appropriate premises.(Opens store inventory) Shepard: I have to go now.Oronath: Then go. Peace be with you.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Oronath: How can this one help you?(Return to last choice) Shepard: I'm here to collect your debt.Oronath: This one does not wish for any trouble. But unfortunately, it has to report business is bad. It has no money.
(Par) I sympathize. (Neu) Don't make it worse. (Ren) I can make it hurt.  Shepard: I don't like it either. Can you give me what they want?Oronath: This one does not expect to have the money shortly. Shepard: If I don't give the Union the money, there'll be trouble.Oronath: This one will be harmed if it does not pay? This one does not expect to have the money shortly. Shepard: Give it to me or I'll break your legs. All of them... somehow.Oronath: This one will be harmed if it does not pay? This one does not expect to have the money shortly.
(Par) You could trade. (Neu) Forget it. (Ren) Use your salary. (P Inv) What do you owe? (R Inv) So you're special?  Shepard: Don't you have anything you could sell?Oronath: This one has medical supplies of value, but they belong to Eldfell-Ashland.| Urdnot Wrex: Surely they value your life more than medigel. Probably.| Garrus Vakarian: I'm sure they'd rather have a living doctor than a few packs of medigel.| Kaidan Alenko: I'm sure they'd rather have a living doctor than a few packs of medigel.| Ashley Williams: I'm sure they'd rather have a living doctor than a few packs of medigel.| Tali'Zorah: I'm sure they'd rather have a living doctor than a few packs of medigel.Oronath: That is a good argument. This one will provide medigel. Sell it to Kar Kath for credits. This one cannot do it. If the transaction was exposed, it would lose its work. Is there anything else it can do for you?
(Par) I'd like medical aid. (Neu) Goodbye. Investigate  Shepard: We need your services.Oronath: This one apologizes fervently for the lack of appropriate premises.(Opens store inventory) Shepard: I have to go now.Oronath: This one looks forward to renewed harmony.(End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Oronath: How can this one help you?(Return to last choice)
(Neu) Return (Inv) Liara T'Soni (Inv) Poor location  (Return to overarching choice) Shepard: Have you seen Liara T'Soni?Oronath: Not recently. But if this one were to say, she often visits the ruins of the Enkindlers.
(P Inv) Enkindlers?  Shepard: Are they religious figures?Oronath: This one apologizes. That is what the Protheans are called among the hanar. The Enkindlers were the perfect embodiment of light. Ah, but this one shouldn't impose its beliefs on others.
(Par) Go on, please. (Neu) I don't have time. (Ren) Indeed, you shouldn't.  Shepard: No, go ahead, it's interesting.Oronath: The Enkindlers sought out the hanar in the dark, before speech sustained our minds. It is they who gifted language to us. The other ones knelt beside the hanar and spoke the first words in the night. And then, as silence fell again, the suns rose. Is it not the same with your people? Some humans claim the ruins on Mars prove that you were gifted by the Enkindlers.
(Par) I suppose. (Neu) It can't be proven. (Ren) What a load of crap.  Shepard: That's one way to interpret it.Oronath: The humans have been blessed. They are destined to be a lever which can move the suns.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: There are no records of it whatsoever.Oronath: Many truths can be lost amid the shadows and storms of history.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: "God" and "flying saucers" can't co-exist within the same sentence.Oronath: This one will not argue.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: I'll pass.Oronath: This one will not argue.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: I can find the flyers on every street corner.Oronath: This one's people are also known for their disinterest in others' way of life.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: Why do you work in here?Oronath: The salarian named "Smiley" acquired the infirmary to make it his residence.
(P Inv) How did that happen?  Shepard: Isn't the infirmary a public institution?Oronath: Forgive this one for contradicting you on this point. The infirmary is Eldfell-Ashland's property. The one named Smiley offered them a large amount of credits. They decided that this one could adequately perform its duties here just as well.(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: We can discuss that later.Oronath: Is there anything else it can do for you?(Return to overarching choice) Shepard: Does the company pay you with rations?Oronath: This one has medical supplies of value, however those are owned by the Eldfell-Ashland corporation.| Urdnot Wrex: Surely they value your life more than medigel. Probably.| Garrus Vakarian: I'm sure they'd rather have a living doctor than a few packs of medigel.| Kaidan Alenko: I'm sure they'd rather have a living doctor than a few packs of medigel.| Ashley Williams: I'm sure they'd rather have a living doctor than a few packs of medigel.| Tali'Zorah: I'm sure they'd rather have a living doctor than a few packs of medigel.Oronath: That is a good argument.

(P Inv) I'll cover it.  Shepard: Don't worry. I'll tell Fred you've paid and take care of it.Oronath: You are extremely generous. This one is indebted to you. Is there anything else it can do for you?
(Par) I'd like medical aid. (Neu) Goodbye.

You're not completely talentless.Fred Mazzei: Yeah, I've got plenty of talents! For instance, I can do that thing with my neck, like this...
(Par) Fred is talented. (Neu) Take advantage. (Ren) He belongs here.  Shepard: Fred knows a bunch about eezo. Using him as a thug is a waste of his skills and experience. Shepard: Fred may be no fighter, but he's an experienced miner. His skills could be put to use here. Shepard: Fred may not be cut out for fighting, but he'd be a valuable asset in this place.Fred Mazzei: What's my ass got to do with it?

That's a load off my head. Phew. You've done me a solid... uhh, one. I'll be taking the money. When Sessa comes back, I'll ask her if I can stay up here to work again. No more collecting. Just tools and stuff, you know? Maybe Wren could slip in a good word for me. Not just any word, a really good one. Something like "cumulativeness", or "antitarnish." Thanks for the help.

Yeah.(End of conversation) Shepard: No, not yet. [sic](End of conversation)(Re-initiating conversation)Fred Mazzei: How's it coming along with that thing I asked you to do?(Return to last choice)

(Neu) Favor for a favor. (Inv) You need help?  Shepard: If you want my help, you must give something in return.Fred Mazzei: I can't pay you, that's my problem. I know a guy who can sneak me out of here. Only, he's asking for a lot of money. Could you spare a thousand credits? Possibly? I'll pay you back.

There was this one guy who asked Sessa if he could leave. Pieces of him clogged the recycling pipes for weeks. I know a guy who can sneak me out of here. Only, he's asking for a lot of money.

Union human: Get to work, jellyfish.
Oronath: With all due respect, this one does not--
Union human: I told you to get to work! Good thing you were there. Those damn aliens always act like they're in charge.

(Par) That's pretty xenophobic. (Neu) This war has to stop. (Ren) You bigoted moron.  Shepard: Just keep in mind that not all aliens are like them.Union human: Is that right? They're all the same around here, in any case.(End of conversation) Shepard: If you're truly grateful, then stop fighting with the Cartel.Union human: We're looking out for ourselves. If we don't stand up to them, they'll never learn to respect us!(End of conversation) Shepard: The "jellyfish" has a name. If you kept your attitude in check, maybe there'd be less trouble around here.Union human: Screw you too! We're looking out for ourselves.

(Par) Stay open-minded. (Neu) This war has to stop. (Ren) Don't insult us again.  Shepard: It seems you're just doing the same as them. Judging an entire species for the actions of a few.Cartel turian: Hmm, yes. You may be right about that.(End of conversation) Shepard: If you're truly grateful, then stop fighting with the Union.Cartel turian: That's not my call. Suggest it to Smiley if you want, it's your funeral.(End of conversation) Shepard: I heard what you said about torching our planets. Better watch out. Your arrogance could turn against you eventually.Cartel turian: I'll keep that in mind.(End of conversation)
