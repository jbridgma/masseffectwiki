Description[]
Altanorch is a small but typical hydrogen-helium gas giant with no outstanding features. Its combination of strong magnetic field and relatively shallow gravity well make it a popular "stopover" world for discharging FTL drive cores.

Survey Text[]

“Scanning Altanorch revealed something of interest in a debris field. Joker brought the Normandy in close and a small team was able to retrieve some valuable detritus, including a League of One medallion.”

Properties[]
Altanorch is too small to be a "typical hydrogen-helium gas giant" (William Hubbard, The New Solar System 4th ed, 1999; p. 194). At 60 solar masses the star is not more than 360000 years old. Altanorch is a superterrestrial protoplanet.
