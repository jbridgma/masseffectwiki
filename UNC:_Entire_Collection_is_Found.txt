This assignment will appear in your journal when you discover your first medallion or ID tag. The in-game Codex claims there are 12 League of One medallions and 4 salarian ID tags scattered throughout the systems, but it suffices for the assignment to find 10 League of One medallions and 3 salarian ID tags.
