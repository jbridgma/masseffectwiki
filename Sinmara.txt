Description[]
Surtur's moon Sinmara has been used for many generations to monitor its parent star Solveig. It has no atmosphere to interfere with solar observational equipment, which is critical at this juncture; the star recently showed signs of erupting prematurely into a red giant.
In preparation for the day when the critical warning goes out, the extranet channel from Sinmara's research station is given top priority throughout the comm buoys in the system. The chances of such a signal being received over the sun's magnetic interference at that time is low, but relegating it to a lower channel proved politically untenable.

Trivia[]
Sinmara may be named after the female companion to the giant Surtur in the Norse mythology.
Though it is noted as lacking an atmosphere, it clearly has one upon landing at the colony research station; as clouds and a distinct coloration of the sky indicates.
The capital may be named after either a former municipality or a moor in Denmark.
