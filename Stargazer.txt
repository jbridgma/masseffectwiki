The Stargazer is a humanoid entity of indeterminate race and background. Depending on Commander Shepard's choice in the final battle for Earth, one of two Stargazers narrates the legendary figure's deeds to a child companion.







“There won't be an Earth left to save...” — Spoilers for Mass Effect 3 follow.




If the Crucible is activated, a male Stargazer is seen finishing his tale of "The Shepard" to the child. He states that it happened long ago, and that many of the details have been "lost" in time. 
If the Crucible is not activated and the Reapers continue their cycle, a female Stargazer of an unknown species is seen finishing the tale of the Shepard. She explains that they know about the Shepard's actions and the war through the archives that Liara T'Soni had left behind. The information the archives contained saved the contemporary generation from the threat, and are the reason why they are at peace.
Whichever way the Stargazer wraps up the tale, the child asks to be told more, and the Stargazer replies that there is time for one more story.

Trivia[]
Early in storyboarding, a "Reaper Queen" presented the final ending choices instead of the Catalyst. The Stargazer scene in the final product evolved from a similar scene in the queen's Synthesis scenario, where the companion and child are distinctly identified as an asari mother-daughter pair but with circuitry patterns. The same circuitry patterns could be seen from dandelion-like things floating on a hill the pair are sitting on, in contrast to the snowy forest in the game.[1]
The male Stargazer is voiced by Buzz Aldrin, an American former astronaut best known for being the second human to set foot on the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission.
