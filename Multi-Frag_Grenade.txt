Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Grenade powers do not have a recharge time and, thus, can be used immediately at any time, provided grenades are available. Using the power consumes one grenade each time.
If the player has multiple grenade powers, the grenade pool is shared between them.
The N7 Destroyer does not toss these grenades by hand; instead, the grenades are fired forward in a conical spread pattern after a short animation where the Destroyer raises its hands, similar to the casting animations of Nightshade Blades or Ballistic Blades.
Three grenade projectiles are fired per use (5 with the rank 6 Grenade Count evolution).
The displayed damage, force, and radius values in the ability details screen for this power are per frag grenade.
This ability has potentially enough force to stagger big targets such as Atlases and Geth Primes and even enough to interrupt a Banshee's sync kill on an ally.
Like most grenade powers, Multi-Frag Grenade can detonate non-biotic Power Combos.
Strategies
Due to the damage being per grenade, the Grenade Count evolution does apply more damage if the grenades are clustered close together. This requires you to be close to the target(s) to minimize grenade spread. Aiming at the ground near your target(s) is preferable.
At longer ranges it is impossible to keep them clustered due to the farther travel trajectory, forcing the grenades to have a wider spread. Use this to your advantage for spread-out groups of enemies.
Because this power has significant force, use it to interrupt Atlas and Geth Prime attacks or slow their advance while also doing a good amount of damage to them.
Availability[]
Single-player: N/A
Multiplayer: N7 Destroyer Soldier
