Description[]
Supay has the composition of an ice dwarf planet, but is unusually large for such a body. It has a trace atmosphere of krypton and xenon. The frozen surface is dotted with deposits composed of potassium and light metals, brought to the surface by cryovolcanic processes.
Supay's icy surface was often used as a source of potable water by passing merchant vessels. Since the Alliance claimed the inner system world of Chasca, satellites placed in orbit automatically bill any vessel landing on the world for the mass of water removed from the surface.
ExoGeni has had a difficult time keeping these satellites operational; they often meet with "accidents" caused by impact with jettisoned ship debris.

Assignments[]

Trivia[]
All planets in the Matano System are named after deities of Inca mythology. Supay is the Inca god of death.
