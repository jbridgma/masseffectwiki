Description[]
Bannik is a large superterrestrial "hothouse" with a crushing carbon dioxide atmosphere. A high average density of over seven grams per cubic centimeter indicates that Bannik is a mineralogical treasure trove. If only there were some way to safely reach its seas of molten metal and lodes of radioactives. The planet's mass is so great that trace amounts of helium and molecular hydrogen can be found in the atmosphere.
