Nuriam is a cut character that was intended to be present in Mass Effect during the deleted assignment Global Plot 3. She is Dr. Euthalia's assistant.
Nuriam is first encountered inside the lystheni underground facility on an asteroid, where she suddenly appears to prevent Shepard's squad from shooting a lystheni worker who had saved her. Nuriam pretends to be Dr. Euthalia when asked by Shepard's squadmates. She gives some information about the virus outbreak and leaves with the Commander.[1] Later, she shows herself to be a fervent lystheni sympathizer, claiming that the hanar are oppressing the lystheni militarily and persecuting them culturally, and she insists that the lystheni had no other choice than to develop bioweapons in retaliation.[2] Soon after, the group happens upon the real Dr. Euthalia, who reveals the true identity of her assistant Nuriam. She also says she's the one who released the lystheni virus, and even used Nuriam as a carrier of the disease. Nuriam storms off in anger and disappears for a time.[3]
Further into the bunker, Shepard has to choose between destroying the facility rapidly to prevent the upload of data harmful to the hanar, or going after Nuriam to rescue her as the squadmates may suggest. If the facility is destroyed, Nuriam is seemingly never heard of again. If Shepard elects to go after Nuriam, Dr. Euthalia will initially oppose it but the squadmates force her to follow along.[4] Shepard finds Nuriam again being attacked by infected lystheni. She seems to be severely injured and practically dying, and Euthalia refuses to heal her. Nuriam tells Shepard to use her remains to find a cure. She dies there unless Shepard can persuade her not to give up on the lystheni's cause, in which case she's taken away from the facility.[5]
In the aftermath, assuming she survived, a hanar representative will mention Nuriam is being treated at one of their medical centers, and assures he will ensure she recovers fully and safely. In the time it takes Shepard to go meet Elarya back on the Citadel, the hanar have informed her that Nuriam is already doing much better.[6]
