Dying in the middle of nowhere with no certainty your message will be conveyedYet somehow they do, repeatedly, seems to be a convenient motif1/2
A dead asari commando left a message to be delivered to her bondmate, Weshra. Find Weshra on the Citadel and deliver the message.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Kallini: Ardat-Yakshi Monastery

You acquire this mission by investigating a PDA in an Ardat-Yakshi monastery. It is on the first chamber with an interior balcony that you reach from the beginning of the mission, where you will encounter Samara if she's alive.
Note:  Unlike most other item retrieval missions in the game, failure to obtain the PDA will permanently lock out this mission as no equivalent can be bought from Spectre Requisitions.

Walkthrough[]

Tashya Porae was badly wounded when she recorded her last message, which included some personal regrets. You can hear the message again for clarity after obtaining the mission.
When you return to the Citadel, go to Presidium Commons. Weshra, labeled as Asari Widow, is standing on the stairs between Meridian Place Market and Apollo's Cafe. On comms, she's unsuccessfully trying to get information on her bondmate's whereabouts or even assignment as it was classified. Talk to her to bring her the bad news and closure.
Note: The mission objective may not show up on the map. You are looking for an asari standing alone on the stairwell. 
You will receive 90 experience and 5 Reputation for completing the mission.
