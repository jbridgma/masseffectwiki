This article is about the class specialization in the first game. For the evolution of the Soldier class power in Mass Effect 2, see Combat Mastery#Commando.


Commando is a specialist class for the Infiltrator and Soldier, with the alternate specialization options being the Operative and the Shock Trooper, respectively. Commandos rely on lethal efficiency and precision strikes rather than brute force to eliminate their opponents. Bonuses include increases to damage and efficiency with weapons, and improvements to the Immunity, Marksman, and Assassination abilities.
