Prerequisite: Priority: Perseus Veil (Mass Effect 3)


The quarian home system used to have a standard economic configuration: a homeworld, helium-3 fuel infrastructure on a gas giant, and several planets for resource extraction. In the centuries since the Morning War, a geth Dyson bubble slowly built up around Tikkun in accordance with the machines' plan to build a megastructure capable of housing all of their programs. The geth-quarian war of 2186 saw every world become a battlefield, with extensive damage dealt to both sides on and around these worlds, and much of the Dyson bubble was reduced to ruin.

The word "tikkun" means "a fix" or "correction" in Hebrew. It is often used as part of the Hebrew phrase "tikkun olam" that means "healing and restoring the world". Several worlds in the system follow a naming scheme based on Jewish culture and beliefs.
