The Shipping Warehouse is a location in the Citadel. Located in Zakera Ward's Mid-Ward District, the warehouse is located on the 26th level of a building. This warehouse serves as a short-term storage area for goods that are waiting to be distributed to the wards or to waiting freighters. The portion of the warehouse accessible consists of a lobby, a staircase, and a conference/reception room. Items can be retrieved from the warehouse if a customer has a service order.
On the day Commander Shepard visits the warehouse, a human is attempting to retrieve an item he believes is stored in the warehouse and is attempting to convince a salarian to help him. Two years before, the human had tried to get a refund from a turian shopkeep.
Later, during Garrus' loyalty mission, the Commander will encounter a volus and his krogan bodyguards in the warehouse.

Trivia[]
The full transcript of the conversation between the human and the salarian can be found on the discussion page.
Before entering the warehouse, an advertisement can be heard promoting the Tupari beverage.
