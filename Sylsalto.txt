Description[]
Sylsalto is a standard hydrogen-helium gas giant. It has no remarkable features.

Properties[]
Sylsalto is too large and close to its sun to be a "standard hydrogen-helium gas giant" (William Hubbard, The New Solar System 4th ed, 1999; p. 194). It is more likely an "ice giant" like Neptune or Gliese 436 b.
