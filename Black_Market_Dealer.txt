Appearances
Mass Effect: Andromeda


The Black Market Dealer of Kadara Slums sells consumables.
Due to her rather secluded location, a shipping container next to Dr. Ryota Nakamoto's personal quarters above his clinic, she has to furtively call the attention of potential customers. Her store policy is no discounts and negotiable refunds.
Her container also has an Alliance Dreadnought Model that can be taken without any complaints from her.
