Description[]
Erros is a turian word meaning "overlook" or "pleasant view," not to be confused with humanity's mythological Eros. The name refers to the planet's nearly absent atmosphere, allowing visiting probes and rovers a sweeping view of its volcanic mountains. Erros's hematite deposits give the world a reddish color. Accessible deposits of iron and copper have attracted second-tier turian and volus conglomerates that robo-mine the surface.
