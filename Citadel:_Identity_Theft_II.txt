Elijah Khan is dead, but intel may be recovered from his data drives. Speak to Brooks to find out what she and EDI have learned.
Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Silver Coast Casino: Infiltration

The mission is automatically awarded once you regain control back at the Personal Apartment.

Walkthrough[]
Shepard orders Brooks and EDI to check the drives for anything useful. Talk to your squadmates to pass the time. They are in the same locations as last time, only with EDI and Liara switched. Once you are ready, talk to Brooks to proceed. 
Tip: Before talking to Brooks you may want to take a moment to customize your armor and check your weapon loadout on the second floor of your apartment. You can now equip the M-11 Suppressor that you picked up during Citadel Wards: Ambush (it will be equipped by default).


EDI and Brooks discover a communication a few days ago, and once Brooks cracks it, she opens the file. On it is a series of purchases—weapons, and big ones. Mechs are part of the included package. Glyph then interrupts to say that Shepard’s Spectre access code was just used at the Citadel Archives. One squadmate (Garrus, or Liara if he's dead) claims it's so restrictive they weren't able to gain clearance to enter there despite ostensibly having the means or authority to do so. As Shepard orders everyone to gear up, they find a volus with a pizza. James apparently got the munchies. Double Pepperoni. 
Brooks then mentions that it is sad that you can’t bring everyone, but Shepard says why not? As everyone around the room audibly clear their throats, the pizza delivery volus also chimes in. Apparently someone needs to pay the bill. 
Now you get to choose your squad for the upcoming mission; the rest will divide themselves into two support teams and come along as well.
