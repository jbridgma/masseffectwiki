Description[]
Adek is a brutally hot and wet garden world, covered with molds and lichen analogues. It has many viruses and bacteria lethal to batarian physiology. The Hegemony colonized Adek early in its expansion, but few of the colonists wanted to stay. The result was domination by a class of landed slave-owners. A small cadre of well-paid engineers and skilled laborers kept the planet's mechs and infrastructure functioning.
Alliance estimates put the planet's batarian population at just over six million, but that number has likely fallen since the Reapers arrived.
