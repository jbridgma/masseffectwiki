Compatibilities[]
Guns - This augmentation can be applied to gun-type weapons.
Description[]
When the current ammo clip is empty, drains 5% of health and refills the clip.

Mechanics[]
Strategies[]
Frequently using the Bio-converter will cause the player to lose health quickly. Not quickly enough to die but quickly.
Combines well with weapons like the Remnant P.A.W..
The player doesn't have to wait to reload or for the heat to drop. This essentially allows constant laser firing  interrupted only by the Bio-converter itself.
With the Team Support Rank 6 Life Support choice (which regenerates your health after you use a Tech skill), the player can completely eliminate the Bio-converter's health drain. This augmentation and skill combination is one of the most useful without a downside.
