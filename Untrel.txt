Untrel is a colonized system in batarian space. A modest economic infrastructure exists between its three terrestrial worlds and one gas giant, although hothouse temperatures in Ezka prevent full exploitation. The Reaper invasion of the system promptly destroyed most of these, though wreckage around Uza suggests that the batarians may have had some infighting during the chaos.
