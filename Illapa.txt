Description[]
Illapa is a hydrogen-helium gas giant with an unusual ruby color caused by contaminants in the atmosphere. The world has over 120 moons, one of the highest totals of all known systems.
Once full development of Chasca colony begins, a helium-3 refining infrastructure will be developed in the Illapa system, concentrated on the large ice moon of Coniraya.

Trivia[]
All planets in the Matano System are named after deities of Inca mythology. Illapa is the Inca god of weather, particularly thunder/lightning; Coniraya is named after the Inca deity of the moon.
