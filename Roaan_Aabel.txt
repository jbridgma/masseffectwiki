“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Mass Effect: Andromeda[]
Roaan Aabel is a friendly angara that willing offers the Pathfinder a drink. If the Pathfinder is interested in the nutrient paste serve at the establishment, Roaan can answer. He explains that nearly everything grown by the angara is sent straight to processing. While not as good as fresh fruit, Roaan proudly states that a single harvest from Aya can feed an entire planet. In addition they are able to ship some off-world. If Ryder displays interest in its efficiency in relieving food shortages, Roann offers to send sample to the Tempest.
When asked about the Tavetaan, as Ryder is unable to translate it with their translator, Roaan goes onto explain the subtle uses of tavetaan stating it could mean 'old friend' if it's a person or a location you someone home to it would be his bar.
