The Styx Theta cluster and the systems within it are named for the Greek underworld, Hades. The name of Erebus, a god representing the personification of darkness and shadow, came to be applied to a portion of the underworld itself.
Erebus was surveyed by the Systems Alliance ship Ibn Battuta, which specifically surveyed Chofen and Quaji. The ship is named after Ibn Battuta, a famous 14th century Moroccan traveller and explorer who has a crater on the Moon named after him.
