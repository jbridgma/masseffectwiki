Evolves Fortification into one of the following options:

Improved Fortification[]

Recharge Time: 12.00 seconds
Duration: 180.00 seconds
Armor Bonus: +75.00% of maximum shields
Heavy Fortification[]
By altering the chemistry of the prime ingredients of the armor, it now absorbs even more damage.
Recharge Time: 12.00 seconds
Duration: 60.00 seconds
Armor Bonus: +100.00% of maximum shields
Player Notes[]
Despite the in-game wording, when used by Shepard as a bonus power, Fortification boosts maximum shield values and also restores shields to their new maximum upon activation. It has no effect on health.
Fortification is functionally the same as Barrier and Geth Shield Boost, and differs only slightly from the Improved evolution of the latter. Like the other two powers, Fortification can be activated without interrupting Shepard when storming.
Unlike Barrier (a biotic power) or Geth Shield Boost (a tech power), Fortification is a "combat" power (like Concussive Shot) that doesn't fall into either category, and therefore does not receive any enhancement from biotic or tech upgrades.  As it possesses no known unique properties or mechanics when compared with Barrier, this makes Fortification clearly an inferior choice for Shepard if both powers are available options.
Unlocking Grunt's Fortification (on completion of Grunt: Rite of Passage) can create the conundrum that he will constantly reactivate it during battles even if Squad Power Use is disabled, making him less likely to use his other powers or be able to use them on demand. The only way to have a loyal Grunt but avoid the automatic use of Fortification is to reset his powers using the Advanced Training terminal at the Shadow Broker's Base (requires either Lair of the Shadow Broker DLC or Legendary Edition) and invest no points in Fortification.

Player Notes[]
The power use penalty at Rank 1 Fortification is not 50% overall reduction to power recharge speed, but a reduction of the Power Recharge Speed bonus visible in the weapon loadout screen. Ex: If you have +200% Power Recharge Speed when looking at the weapons screen, activating Rank 1 Fortification reduces that Power Recharge Speed to +150%.
The power speed penalty reduction of 30% at Rank 6 Fortification reduces the penalty down to 20%. E.g. if you have a +200% Power Recharge Speed bonus in the weapon screen, activating Rank 6 Fortification only reduces the bonus to +180%.
Fortification's damage protection bonus can stack with additional powers.
Fortification can be activated instantly while moving, and will not cause the character to stop and perform any activation animations. Similarly, de-activating Fortification is also instant. This allows rapid response to highly fluid combat situations.
In order to gain/maintain the extra melee damage, one must purge their Fortification every 20 seconds. For the Krogan Soldier and to some degree the Geth Soldier, this has little effect if done when your shields are at max, as you can still withstand a fair amount of abuse even without the extra protection. For the Geth Soldier this provides a much more effective area melee, and for Krogan Soldiers it can boost their melee damage to an even higher level.
Since Fortification's cooldown is fairly quick even with a lot of extra weight, one can also take a heavy loadout and still be fairly effective, or use light weapons for near-instantaneous cooldowns. A lower cooldown means you can regain your protection faster, and for Krogan Soldiers going for a melee build, this can be a life saver.
