Knoeth is the head scientist of Hjara Station. He has a knack for trusting his gut instinct and discovering breakthroughs because of it.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Background[]
Knoeth used to be a seismologist on Aya before volunteering for Hjara. He grew bored of Aya's greenery, came to Voeld for the adventure, and so far the planet lived up to his expectations. He loved scaling mountains in particular, and Voeld had plenty to offer.

The first time he speaks to Pathfinder Ryder he warns them to watch their step as the scientists buried data probes in the snow. He may then divulge his backstory and some tidbits about Hjara Station.
As lead researcher, Knoeth can often be heard giving orders based on what his underlings report. On discovering a cave, he wants it scouted by a seismology team for avalanche prevention. His team obtained a metal sample from a dig site with possible Resistance applications, so he wants them to keep digging as he's confident they can find more. If Ryder defeated the world's Architect, he advises the team sent to study it to maintain a healthy distance as there could be Remnant nearby.
Through the messages addressed to him at a nearby terminal, Knoeth is also aware of yevara poaching and the discovery of an eiroch nesting ground thanks to his own efforts.
