The Armstrong Nebula is located in the Skyllian Verge. Most of its worlds are unexplored, primitive, or notable only for a few geological features. Denizens from the Terminus Systems frequently pick places in the nebula to serve as anchorages, drive discharge sites, or some other out-of-the-way operation. Pirates abound in the nebula, though Alliance patrols do have some presence here as a counter.






“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




According to intelligence gathered by Alliance surveillance drones (or by Commander Shepard from hacked terminals on Feros or Virmire), the cluster is being used as a staging ground by geth forces. While Admiral Hackett can only speculate if the geth are preparing for attacks on human colonies or just gathering intel, data on the terminals indicate that Saren Arterius intends to use them for a major offensive against Citadel Space.

The Armstrong Nebula is named after Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the moon. The systems themselves are named for landmarks in human space exploration.
The cluster view design is identical to the Arcturus Stream.
