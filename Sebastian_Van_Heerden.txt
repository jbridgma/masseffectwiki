Mass Effect (cut)


Sebastian Van Heerden is a character who was cut from Mass Effect. He was a hired mercenary on Throw Down station on Caleston, and was assigned to guard Tatiana Naidenov inside Ruushok's bar The Seventh Moon.
Van Heerden used to be a Sergeant within the Alliance's 101st "Screaming Eagle" Jump Infantry (service number T147S0382). Retired, he has taken up work as a mercenary for hire, and was secretly tasked by Nonya Tombiri to kidnap and guard Tatiana Naidenov, former prostitute and Jason Harrah's lover, to use as leverage for his cooperation. Van Heerden will respect Commander Shepard for being also part of the Alliance and outranking him, and may be persuaded to let Shepard talk to Naidenov. He may also be talked into revealing the nature of his assignment and Naidenov's captivity if Shepard appeals to his military honor.[1]
During the course of the assignment Caleston: Redemption, Shepard may go with Harrah to The Seventh Moon to try to arrest Van Heerden. He staunchly refuses, and the two men reach for their guns. While Harrah's survival is dependant on certain factors, Van Heerden would end up dead from this, no matter what.[2]

Trivia[]
Internal data points to "Hieraxun" being an alternative name for Van Heerden.[3]
