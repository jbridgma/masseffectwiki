Description[]
Azrahas is a hothouse planet rich in nitrogen, methane, and ethane. Similar to Namakli, it is metal-poor. Additionally, it is suspected that few asteroid impacts have struck it over the millennia, precluding accessible deposits of common precious metals in the crust. Decrepit asari orbital stations from scientific expeditions long ago circle the planet. None display signs of occupation.
