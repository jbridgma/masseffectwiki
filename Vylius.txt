Description[]
Vylius is a hydrogen-methane ice giant drifting out in the frozen depths. Its orbit hosts rings of rock and ice as well as many moons, all drawn from what would otherwise be a secondary asteroid field similar to Sol's Kuiper Belt.
Vylius is named for a trickster figure in asari mythology, a crafty animal called a manal that seduced asari maidens who then gave birth to hideously deformed offspring. In the tales, Vylius is caught and punished, but they serve as a warning to young asari not to initiate a bond with anyone they cannot trust.
