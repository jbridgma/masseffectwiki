Mass Effect (cut)


Maddie Kedward is a character who was cut from Mass Effect during development. She was a prostitute on Caleston, and could only engage in any conversations with a male Commander Shepard, while a female Shepard would have to talk to Matthew Baudelaire.
Like her male counterpart, Maddie originates from Earth and ended up on Caleston thanks to the Union and the "contractual transit" system, an agreement that allows destitute citizens of Earth to travel to a colony. In exchange, Maddie ended up working as a prostitute to pay the Union back. She resents her job, and laments that she has no choice in the matter, as Eldfell-Ashland Energy would claim it's none of their business.[1] She can offer some insight into the situation between Jason Harrah and Tatiana Naidenov to Shepard.[2] If the Union is eventually taken down, she is grateful to Shepard as the Union's prostitution ring also ceases to exist. She says she now works at the refinery and is unsure whether she'll stay on Caleston in the future.[3]
In an alternative plotline, another cut assignment called Caleston: Free Prostitutes would have allowed Shepard to free Maddie and Matthew from their contractual obligations.
