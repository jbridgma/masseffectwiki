Description[]
Atos Irn was claimed, along with the rest of its system, after the volus learned FTL travel. In the great volus exploration push of 300 BCE, the species found only a few planets capable of supporting their colonies. They did, however, discover many planets teeming with valuable elements.
The orbiting robo-mining platforms of Atos Irn have since been shot through by the Reapers. Little remains except the occasional bit of space debris posing a navigation hazard.
