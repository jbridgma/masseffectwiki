Description[]
First charted by the salarians, Tunfigel (which means "hard heart") is noted for its platinum and uranium deposits, making robo-mining a lucrative activity. While the surface temperature is well within the range of a comfortable EVA excursion, the extremely dense Tunfigel generates a dangerous gravitational pull five times that of Earth. The salarian miners exploiting the planet derisively nickname planets such as these "elcor tourist traps".
