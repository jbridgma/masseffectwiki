Nalon is one of the curators of the Repository of History on Aya. He and fellow curator Elihn help their boss Avela Kjar with her studies. He specializes in restoring artifacts.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




During Pathfinder Ryder's first contact with the angara, Nalon is one of the curious onlookers observing the Pathfinder walking through their streets to the Resistance Headquarters. He wonders how "it" found them, though Avela quickly corrects him with the proper pronoun and berates him to stop staring.
Later, when Ryder has been allowed full access to the rest of the city, Nalon can talk to them about how he watched them land the first time. Ryder remembers being called an "it", and Nalon apologizes for being ignorant. 
Nalon can be overheard reporting to Avela they've got another Remnant artifact from Elaaden despite searching for angaran ones. On her orders, he's still slated to pay the founders for their efforts.
If asked about his job, Nalon claims he makes relics look as new as he can, but not to the miracle worker levels Avela lauds his efforts to be. He never had a supervisor like Avela before who would praise him and Elihn to anyone who will listen.
After the discoveries at Khi Tasira, Nalon can be found talking to Elihn about Avela's behavior. He thinks the reveal of angara being artificial creations profoundly affected her.
