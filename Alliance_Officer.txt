Player Notes[]
The Rank 6 Squad Bonus evolutions apply to all members of the party including Ashley/Kaidan. There is possibility for confusion, as similarly named "Squad Bonus" evolutions on Shepard's various class powers do not apply to Shepard, only to NPC squadmates.
Kaidan's shield-recharge Squad Bonus can stack with the similar evolution of Javik's Vengeful Ancient class power.
Ashley's Rank 6 Squad Bonus is the only Squad Bonus evolution of any squadmate's class passive that buffs the weapon damage of the party; however, it comes with the severe tradeoff of sacrificing a massive increase to her damage with assault rifles.
