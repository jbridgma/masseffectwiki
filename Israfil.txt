Description[]
Largest of the "eezo trio," Israfil is a silicate-heavy carbonaceous asteroid. It is home to approximately 40 species of microorganisms in its liquid water, and was blamed as the source of the prion-based biowarfare agent EHE (exotic humanoid encephalopathy) used by the terrorist group Totenkopf in their attack on Gagarin Station in 2184.
While many in the scientific community protested that Israfil did not have sufficient atmosphere or evolutionary history to sustain life on the prion level, the asteroid and its eezo miners were nevertheless quarantined to reassure the public that the Systems Alliance was taking action. Though no evidence has yet been found that EHE originated from Israfil or was even synthesized in a local lab, The SSV Manila and a team of epidemiologists maintain watch over the asteroid's ship traffic for now.

Trivia[]
Israfil may be named after the trumpet angel in Islam.
Totenkopf (literally "head of a dead man") refers to only the skull. It does not mean but can be used to describe Death's head.
SSV Manila may be named after the capital of the Philippines.
