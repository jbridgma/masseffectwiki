This article is about the power in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. For the skill in Mass Effect: Andromeda, see Incinerate (skill).

Incinerate is a tech power in Mass Effect 2, and in Mass Effect 3's single-player and multiplayer modes.
Note:  As with all projectile powers, the power does not launch an actual projectile when used by a squadmate. Instead, it impacts instantly.

Player Notes[]
Incinerate deals the listed damage to shields and barriers only.  It uses a 2.4 multiplier against armor, 1.26 against organic health (0.86 is applied instantly, 0.4 as damage over time) and 0.316 against unprotected synthetics (a quarter of the damage dealt to organics).[1]
Despite dealing damage over time, Incinerate is not affected by power duration upgrades.[1]
If there is any cover between Shepard (not the squadmate using it) and the target, the power will strike the cover instead.
Damage is dealt instantly (i.e. not "over time") against protections (armor, barriers, and shields).
Like Overload, this power causes unprotected pyro-type enemies equipped with flamethrowers to explode. To cause this effect, it must land on exposed health (red bar); breaking the target's protection and damaging the health with leftover damage will NOT detonate the fuel tanks.
Most unprotected humanoid organics panic for the duration, and there is a chance that they can be completely knocked to the ground. Other unprotected organic enemy types such as varren can be stunned. Most protected enemies are briefly staggered upon being hit. Klixen are not staggered and their health is highly resistant to fire damage, as is that of most synthetic enemies such as geth.
Hitting the unprotected health of enemies such as vorcha and krogan permanently stops their health regeneration.
A leveled up Incinerate may be a better and more damaging alternative to Overload against weakly protected enemies. This is because Incinerate is capable of depleting an enemy's protections and causing additional damage to their health with any leftover damage, whereas Overload can take out protections but never damages organic health.

Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Incinerate does 1.5x damage against armor, but only half damage (0.5x) against barriers and shields.[2]
Incinerate actually only does 75% of its damage up-front, the other 25% is dealt as a damage-over-time ("DoT") effect over 3 seconds (which is distinct from the Rank 5 Burning Damage evolution that provides a DoT effect).[3]
Unlike its Mass Effect 2 version, Incinerate no longer has an area of effect baseline, only the Rank 4 Radius evolution allows it to hit multiple grouped targets. Taking this evolution can also allow the power to land even on enemies attempting to dodge the projectile. It also can enable Incinerate to simultaneously both prime and/or detonate Power Combos on separate targets (though only one target maximum can be detonated per cast).
Unlike in Mass Effect 2, Incinerate does not halt enemy health regeneration, though Incendiary Ammo/Rounds does.
Incinerate will prime almost all targets hit for a Fire Explosion for several seconds. This includes even protected targets still possessing shields, barriers, or armor. The priming effect lasts several seconds but the burning visual cue of the prime is not the same as the general burning effect of the power itself. Taking the Rank 5 Burning Damage evolution does not extend the duration of the priming effect.
Like similar evolutions for other powers that bestow a DoT effect, the Rank 5 Burning Damage evolution is 40% (or 50% multiplayer) of the overall damage of the power, whereas other evolutions that increase power damage are based off the base—i.e. un-upgraded—damage.[4]
The longer duration of the Burning Damage DoT over the normal DoT (8 seconds versus 3 seconds) does increase how long organic enemies are panicked.[5]
The Rank 6 Armor Damage bonus is a multiplicative increase, raising Incinerate's total damage multiplier against armor from 1.5x to 2.25x (as opposed to 2.0x).[6]
The rank 6 Freeze Combo bonus is multiplicative, affecting all damage components of the Incinerate (instant damage, built-in damage-over-time and rank 5 Burning Damage). Calculations are made upon impact and are not readjusted even if the chill/freeze effect expires before the burning DoT.[7]
The damage of any Fire Explosions or other Power Combos caused by the Incinerate are not enhanced by Freeze Combo.
Strategies
When used in tandem with Overload or Arc Grenades, the two powers can be alternated for a potentially endless sequence of Fire Explosions and Tech Bursts, as each power simultaneously detonates a combo and sets up a new one. This is effective against almost all targets, but especially armored or shielded/barriered enemies.
The Radius evolution of Incinerate and the Chain evolutions of Overload enables each cast of Incinerate to prime multiple targets for Fire Explosions, and allows each cast of Overload to potentially set off 2 or even 3 such combos.
It will also remove the tech priming from multiple targets at once and often prevent multiple detonations from one primer cast, making it a less obvious choice when paired up with Arc Grenade or Snap Freeze.
Incinerate is also very effective against Reapers as a whole since most of their units are either armored, or only have health and Incinerate destroys the bodies of creatures killed by it, keeping Cannibals from eating the corpses. In the case of Incinerate, when the Rank 6 Armor Damage evolution is picked, it does an extra 50% damage against, potentially allowing for over 1500 damage to be inflicted with just one Incinerate on armored foes (including damage over time). When the Rank 4 Radius evolution is picked, it can also panic multiple organic enemies at once, making them all prone to Fire Explosions or vulnerable to additional punishment, e.g. headshots.
The Rank 6 Freezing Damage gives a decent payoff if the character has a method for reliably freezing or chilling enemies.
In single-player, the Engineer, Sentinel, Soldier, and Infiltrator classes have access to cryo attacks; the only NPC squad member who does is Kaidan with Cryo Blast.
For the N7 Paladin Sentinel, the "Freeze Combo" evolution's damage bonus only applies to enemies merely chilled by Snap Freeze.
For characters who lack this freezing option, like the Quarian Male Engineer or the Salarian Engineer, taking the +50% damage vs Armor upgrade is usually the better choice, although Cryo Rounds can be equipped to enable weapon fire to chill or freeze enemies.
Because the Rank 5 Burning Damage evolution adds a multiplicative bonus to the damage, especially high in multiplayer, this evolution is the obvious choice on almost any setup, especially when playing on higher difficulties where enemies won't die from one Incinerate cast. Even though Incinerate isn't as effective against shields or barriers, the burn duration is useful for preventing those protections from starting to recharge, especially on higher difficulties where the delay before recharging begins is much shorter.

Bugs[]
In Mass Effect 3, Incinerate has a buggy interaction with Incendiary Ammo (which itself has a buggy interaction with itself); both erroneously use the same damage effect, and once Incendiary Ammo is applied on an enemy under the effect of Incinerate, both damage-over-time effects get combined into an overly-damaging 3 second damage-over-time that is still technically considered by the game as "Incinerate", making the ammo use Incinerate's damage modifiers, which will let Incendiary Ammo do damage to shields and barriers.[8] In addition, the buggy damage-stacking of Incendiary Ammo will still work, multiplying the effect.
