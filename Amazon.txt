Amazon is a system of four terrestrial planets and one gas giant. Its star is a long-period intrinsic variable red giant, currently at the nadir of a 16-year cycle. At peak, its energy output doubles.
While none of its worlds are rich in any particular resource, there are several isolated mineral nodes worth taking throughout the system. Through sheer coincidence or some other factor, two turian insignias from different outposts can also be recovered from here.
