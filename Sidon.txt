Description[]
A large terrestrial planet with wide, cold deserts, Sidon has a trace atmosphere that is principally carbon monoxide. Alliance planners found its gravity agreeable, however, and built a small domed research facility on the planet in the 2160s. The project was classified until recently, when Blue Suns mercenaries who allegedly attacked the facility were apprehended and brought to trial, revealing the facility's existence in open court.
Eager to counter the negative publicity, Elysium investment firms now advertise that Sidon is free of military facilities and just "minutes away" from the garden world, thanks to recent improvements in faster-than-light travel. Whether or not the marketing attracts development remains to be seen.

Trivia[]
Sidon may be named after the ancient port city of the same name in Lebanon, similar to how most other locations in the Petra Nebula, including the nebula itself, are named after locations in the Levant.
The events of the mercenary attack were major plot points in the novel, Mass Effect: Revelation.
