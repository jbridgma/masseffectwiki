Pay attention to the grunts in the lower decksA few measly credits may end up contributing to the game's macguffin with the right eggheads brainstorming ideas1/2Chief Engineer Adams has requested a GX12 thermal pipe to make the Normandy's engines safer. Find one on the Citadel and deliver it to him.
Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven

Speak to Adams on the Normandy's engineering deck. After Priority: Sur'Kesh, however, Mordin Solus/Padok Wiks and Eve will occupy the med bay, and Adams will temporarily reside in the crew quarters. In this case, Adams will only return to his station and request to speak with you after you have completed any two missions involving landing on a world (Leviathan and Omega missions count toward this).

Walkthrough[]

Head to the Citadel and purchase the E-Gel Thermal Conduit at the Elkoss Combine Arsenal Supplies kiosk located at the Bank in the Presidium Commons for 1,000 credits.
Alternately, if you have already previously visited the Elkoss Combine Arsenal Supplies kiosk, head to the Normandy's Shuttle Bay and access the Alliance Requisitions terminal. You can purchase the item with a 10% surcharge.
If you speak to Adams right after purchasing the item, he tells you that they are performing modifications for the installation. When you visit him again after a completed mission, he tells you that the thermal pipe has been successfully installed, thus completing the assignment. Traynor will also notify Shepard that Adams wants to talk to them when the installation is complete.
You will gain 5 Reputation and 375 experience. If Kenneth and Gabby are alive and were pardoned, schematics for Optimized Eezo Capacitors will be sent to the Crucible project.
