Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Unlike in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, Energy Drain will restore shields and barriers even if used on a non-synthetic and non-shielded enemy.
So long as an enemy is targeted, they will be hit with Energy Drain even if they are behind cover.
Strategies
With Team Support's Rank 6 Life Support passive bonus of restoring health when using a Tech skill, Energy Drain will be able to restore both health and shields when used, making it very useful on higher difficulties. When used with Energy Drain's Rank 6 Team Drain upgrade, the effect is functionally similar to Cora Harper's Shield Boost power with the Rank 6 Regeneration upgrade.
