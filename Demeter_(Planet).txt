Demeter is a garden world colonized by humans in 2152, and their first extrasolar colony. This planet is in a system within reach of conventional FTL drives from the Sol system and was colonized before any system beyond the Charon Relay. The investment money for this colony is raised by the Delta Pavonis Foundation. By 2185, Demeter is home to the Ross School of Art.

Trivia[]
Demeter may be named after the goddess of agriculture and wheat in Greek mythology.
