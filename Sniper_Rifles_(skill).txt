Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Sniper Rifles is a passive skill that is always active.
Given the current patch (Update 1.10) state of affairs, -% reduction of a weapon's weight is somewhat limited from both items and skills. Even with -25% from this skill and supposedly another -10% and -15% from Scavenger Armor - it does not reduce weight by 50%, it makes a 50 weight point sniper rifle weigh 36, which is only 14 points reduction in weight, requiring 10 skill-points investment and armor slots wasted. Consider investing skill points in Combat Fitness and Auxiliary Systems (+25/40 Weight Capacity, not % based even when it states it is).
Strategies
Sniping pairs best with long range Skills, especially those that hit the enemy through cover. A Sniper Rifle Receiver Mod on a sniper rifle takes this even further with the penetration stat.
Make sure to bring a different type of weapon, as sniper rifles make Ryder the most vulnerable.
Using a high damage rifle like the Black Widow with the Rank 6 Damage & Force option, will allow a headshot on Insanity difficulty to kill basic enemies outright, depending on what other passives Ryder has such as the Infiltrator Profile Weapon Headshot/Weak Point Damage Bonus.
The Rank 5 Reload upgrade does not affect the cooldown period of a weapon that uses the Vintage Heat Sink.
