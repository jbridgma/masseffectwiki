Appearances
Mass Effect: Andromeda


Cody Holdren is an Andromeda Initiative merchant on Havarl. She appears on Pelaav Research Station once Pathfinder Ryder initiates Initiative-angaran cooperation by talking to Foster Addison after [[A Dying Planet|resetting the Remnant vault]] on the world.
Cody primarily sells Initiative armor and consumables, mostly from the Nexus and some from "secret" suppliers. Speaking with a vaguely cowgirl accent, she plans to build the first angara-Nexus trading company and name it "Lone Star Enterprises" in honor of her roots. She wants Ryder to invest in her company, promising "great supplies" in return.
