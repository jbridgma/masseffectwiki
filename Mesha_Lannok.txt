Mass Effect: Andromeda


Dr. Mesha Lannok is a fertility specialist working at the Andromeda Initiative outpost on New Tuchanka. She helps krogan have children, a position she frequently has to defend due to her race's role with the genophage.
When talked to by Pathfinder Ryder, the doctor announces there are no births in the colony so far since the krogan do not yet feel secure, a biological reflex she attributes to psychological patterns concerning colonization. Ryder also expresses surprise at her given profession considering she's salarian, but Dr. Lannok only wishes to help the krogan thrive regardless of whether the Initiative agrees with her or not.
If Ryder warns about unchecked krogan expansion as a consequence, the doctor counters it's the same narrow-mindedness that led to the race's decline. They're playing by a new galaxy's rules now, and she makes the case for trusting the krogan to do the right thing. If Ryder agrees with her work, Dr. Lannok surmises the krogan have much better chances in Heleus than back in the Milky Way, and it's up to the Initiative to help them along.
Dr. Lannok can be overheard attending to a krogan patient whom she prescribed supplements for. The patient complains it tastes bad, though the doctor tells him he wasn't supposed to chew them.
