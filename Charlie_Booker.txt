Mass Effect (cut)


Charlie Booker is a cut character during the development of Mass Effect. He was Throw Down's harbormaster on Caleston.
Before Shepard would meet Booker, he could be heard receiving a call from administrator Nonya Tombiri asking him to relay the information that she wants to see the Commander.[1] During the dialogue with Shepard that follows, Booker also states his given role and if Shepard takes a defiant tone, he will threaten to have the SSV Normandy impounded. Booker also addresses Shepard differently depending on gender; he seems more impatient with a male Shepard, but will tastelessly flirt with a female Shepard and repeatedly call her "sweetheart." Eventually, regardless of gender, Shepard may force him to be more respectful by pulling a gun on him, after which he will always address Shepard as "sir" or "ma'am." He nonetheless doesn't hide his sexism or his attraction for asari, namely the one Shepard came to Throw Down to find.[2]
Additionally, Charlie Booker is a merchant and various items could be bought from him, though he initially warns that he doesn't have anything "special." However, with the use of Charm or Intimidate, he can be convinced to show his full inventory. Booker is also in charge of a garage for land vehicles, where he could repair and outfit the M35 Mako (vehicle customization was also eventually cut from the game).
