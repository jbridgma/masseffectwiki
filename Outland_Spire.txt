The Outland Spire is a region on Eos characterized by a giant lake (aptly named Big Lake by Peebee) with surrounding Remnant ruins. To its west is the Sawtooth Plateau and to its north is Prodromos.
There are a couple of kett encampments in the area as well as Scourge-infested Remnant sites. Local wildlife include taurg, challyrion, and creepers. It only has one mining spot—around the "gateway arch" leading to Prodromos—which can yield rich amounts of aluminum, graphite, and iron. The bluish-green gas that permeates much of Presson Dunes is also prevalent in the area particularly below cliffs.
According to Grace Lito, the Outland Spire can be seen from almost anywhere.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Following the activation of Eos' Remnant vault, the Remnant structures on the lake and on the shore have begun resonating. One of three pieces of rem-tech that Peebee requires to be able to build her "Remnant mystery detector" is on the lake's island. While a console on the shore raises platforms for reaching the island by foot, another console on the island activates a gravity well system for a more convenient transport on or off site.
