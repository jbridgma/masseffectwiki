Description[]
By normal standards a large rock planet, Pahhur ("fiery") is constantly scorched by the white, bright giant it orbits. A dense atmosphere featuring hydrogen, helium, and clouds of vaporized magnesium float [sic] over its iron-rich core, making for a truly hellish landscape. Its spectacular temperature prevents any practical exploitation.
