Location: Milky Way / Silean Nebula / Loropi

Prerequisite: Priority: Rannoch (Mass Effect 3)

Description[]
The asari once had enormous solar collectors around the bluish-white A0V star Loropi, using the star's considerable heat to create antiprotons for military starship fuel. Now, all that can be detected is scrap. Reapers emerged from dark space near the Silean Nebula cluster and established a front in Loropi's system. The asari fleet that guarded what used to be known as Espota Station cannot be found--it is scattered and destroyed. One can only hope that the backup reactors in the Kypladon system do not fall, or the asari fleet will have precious little fuel.
