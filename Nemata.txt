Description[]
Nemata is a terrestrial planet with a thick, hazy atmosphere of ammonia, methane, and a cocktail of other hydrocarbon gasses. The surface is scorching hot, and mainly composed of nickel with deposits of iron.
With a density 1.4 times that of Earth, it is obvious that Nemata is rich with heavier elements. Mining could be extremely profitable, though the lethal heat and high gravity make initial development costly. Given the political instability of the nearby Terminus Systems, investment is unlikely.
