Mass Effect: Andromeda


Zear is a grouchy resident of Charybdis Point. He set up a lot of mines around the perimeter because he likes explosions and seeing "squishy things" fly.
If Pathfinder Ryder talks to him, he wonders how they got past the mines. He then thinks scavengers must have disarmed them again. Ryder can suppose he doesn't like visitors, or tell him mining his front yard isn't smart, though he takes offense at the latter. Snarking if Ryder's a professional landscaper, Zear more angrily dismisses them compared to the former option.
His personal log nearby indicates he plans to discontinue mining outside, deeming it a "stupid precaution" against attack anyway. He looks forward to taking on anyone who would wish to fight him. 







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Zear ends up murdered and his death can be investigated by the Pathfinder. He was found shot to death and with his frontal plate pried off. SAM's forensic analysis indicates that Zear was living off the local wildlife while drinking ryncol. He was ambushed by at least three angara who had no interest in looting him, then after his frontal plate was removed he was shot in the head. 
The footprints, residual DNA, and the murder weapon left behind bearing the Shelesh inscription "A home filled with strangers becomes a prison", support Reyes Vidal's theory that the Roekaar made an example of Zear. Reyes and Ryder locate the xenophobes' stronghold and proceed to eliminate them.
