Pasi is a veteran survival instructor on Hjara Station. She mentors the eager but inexperienced Reima on Voeld's dangers.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Pasi impresses upon her student that living on Voeld is different from living on Havarl. She recommends taking every  opportunity to recharge whenever the scant sunlight shows up, limiting exposure to five minutes in order to avoid kett detection.
Pathfinder Ryder can intrude on their conversation and Pasi is willing to answer the human's questions. She can lecture the Pathfinder on the importance of sunlight on angaran bodies, though her survival tricks won't do Ryder any good because of differing biologies. 
When Ryder leaves them be, Reima is keen to put what he learned to use for the Resistance. Pasi isn't willing to let him go just yet, as she needs to teach him how to read weather patterns before she can consider him ready.
