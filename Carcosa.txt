Description[]
Carcosa was thought to be a naturally occurring hothouse planet until an asari expedition discovered palatial ruins on its barren surface. Likely the seat of an ancient city, the crumbling edifice dates back more than 2.7 million years. The only intact chamber appears to be a throne room, overlooking a large depression believed to have once been an enormous lake.
There is evidence that the people of Carcosa polluted their planet until it became uninhabitable, triggering a runaway greenhouse effect and spoiling the planet's fresh water supply. Research into the planet's long history will have to wait—asari scientists evacuated when word of the Reaper attack reached the system, leaving behind data drones to explain their findings to anyone who survives.

Trivia[]
Carcosa is a fictional city in Ambrose Bierce's short story "An Inhabitant of Carcosa." The fictional city was expanded upon in the short story The King in Yellow by Robert W Chambers. In the play, it is the city that is named Carcosa. The palace of the King in Yellow overlooks the Lake of Hali. The only significant difference is that Chambers's Carcosa is supposed to orbit Aldebaran.
