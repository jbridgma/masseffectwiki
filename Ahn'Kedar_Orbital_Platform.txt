The Ahn'Kedar Orbital Platform is a space station orbiting above an unknown planet. Due to the high number of batarians in the area, it is likely that both the planet and space station are under batarian control. The batarian ambassador Jath'Amon claims the space station to be a research station. Jacob Taylor investigates the station, after hearing from his informant Miranda Lawson that several scientists are reportedly being held hostage there.







“Sorry pal. I can't let you in here.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect Galaxy follow.





Upon arriving at the Ahn'Kedar Orbital Platform, Jacob discovers the research agenda to be a front. Along with the krogan Nax, who is searching for his captive scientist friend Batha, Jacob battles his way through the platform and discovers Dr. Hendricks, one of the hostages. Hendricks claims the batarians have fallen prey to a terrible disease, and that the batarians brought the scientists there to develop a cure. In truth, the disease was engineered by the batarians in order to assassinate the Citadel Council. With the help of Nax, Jacob rescues Batha and the other scientists and leaves the station with her knowledge of the cure.
