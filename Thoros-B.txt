“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Thoros-B is a biotoxin which was being developed by Dr. Zev Cohen on Noveria. He claims it was based on "an exotic lifeform discovered on the frontier". Binary Helix wanted something that could kill the creature, but there was no profit in a bioweapon that only affected one rare species, and Cohen was ordered to develop it to affect more species. 
An accident during quarantine infected several members of Cohen's team with the toxin. With some persuation, he may ask Commander Shepard to fetch a cure from their lab. This cure is made from four chemicals that must be mixed in precise amounts or else the result will spoil.
