Description[]
Karora is essentially a great rock in space, tidally locked to Amada. Its only notable feature is a chain of craters stitching across the northern hemisphere, thought to be the result of impacts by a swarm of meteors. Karora's low density suggests it contains no mineral wealth beyond common light metals. It maintains a tenuous atmosphere of krypton and xeon.

Trivia[]
Karora may be named after the creator god in the Australian Aboriginal mythology.
Despite the description stating Karora is tidally locked, the planet's stats oddly say otherwise.
