Lost Drones


We launched a bunch of early drones for recon and specimen recovery. Eos' hostile environment caused a lot of them to malfunction. My hands are full with fixing doors around the settlement. Can someone please search for them? Nav coordinates of launch locations are included. Mark them with a beacon and our team will recover them! - Technician Fessenden

Find all the drones[]
The locations of the drones are marked on the map with navpoints (in no particular order). Most of them lie outside the boundaries of labeled Eos territories.
