Bodyguards are batarians that are encountered during the X57: Bring Down the Sky assignment. Their job is to protect and keep their leader, Balak, alive.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




When confronting Balak at the main facility on Asteroid X57, Shepard has the choice to either allow the research team to die from an exploding bomb, or to let Balak and his bodyguards go to save the researchers. If Shepard allows the research team to die, a battle with Balak and his bodyguards will take place.

Tactics[]
Bodyguards carry standard weapons and have light shields. The Bodyguards will tend to move around to flank their enemies and typically seem to move as a squad. Because of their assault rifles they are good at any distance at taking out their enemies.
