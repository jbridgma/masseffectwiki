Devlon Industries is best known for producing basic armor models that can withstand a variety of environmental extremes such as cold, heat or toxic exposure. They also market a complete line of military grade weapons. Devlon Industries produces the following armors: Explorer Armor, Liberator Armor, Thermal Armor, and Survivor Armor.
If any member of the squad is present while wearing Survivor, Explorer, Liberator, or Thermal Armor, it will negate the timer on environments with Level 1 environmental hazards and slow down the timer on Level 2 for the entire shore party.
A licence for Devlon Industries gear can be purchased from Delan on the Citadel for a cost of 6,250 credits.

Mass Effect 2[]
In Mass Effect 2, Devlon Industries manufactures the M-92 Mantis Sniper Rifle
Powerful sniper rifle able to take out most targets in a single shot. Incredibly accurate at long range, but rate of fire is slow. Effective against armor, but weaker against shields and biotic barriers. Manufactured by Devlon Industries, the Mantis is primarily used by police and planetary militia groups. The prevalence of kinetic barriers has made this weapon less popular with the military, but it is used more frequently in the Terminus system where these defenses are less common. Has great damage and accuracy with near instantaneous hit, offset however by its small amount of extra ammo that can be carried.
Armor[]
All of Devlon Industries' armors are environmentally sealed, effectively reducing the hazard level of the environment. In counterpart, their overall efficiency is reduced when compared to most other armors.[2]

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 47: Devlon Industries' Advanced Fusion gives +10% to Damage, +6% to Heat Absorption and +25% to Accuracy. While the calculations seem correct for Damage when compared to baseline stats, they don't match in the other two cases despite clear increases being visible.

↑ Mass Effect Official Prima Guide, page 47: Devlon Industries' "Environmentally Sealed" gives -7 to DP (incorrectly written as -7%), -20% to Shields, -20% to Hardening but have the special effect "Reduces environmental Hazards by 1 Level". When compared to baseline stats, calculations for DP and Shields appear correct but not Hardening, despite a clear decrease being apparent.
