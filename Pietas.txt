Description[]
Though Pietas has a combination of features that make terraforming a possibility, the rights to the planet have been tied up in Citadel Council courts for the past eight years. The running joke is that by the time the Council finally gives the go-ahead to colonize the planet, Pietas will have evolved life of its own. Home to comfortable temperatures and a mild atmosphere of mostly nitrogen and argon, Pietas could be habitable with the addition of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria. Its crust is high in silicates and carbon, allowing for easy fabrication of construction materials.
Smugglers, pirates, and other unregistered starships sometimes touch down on Pietas to lay low or make repairs. Civilian travel is not advised.

Trivia[]
Pietas in Latin is often translated as "dutifulness", and was seen as one of the core virtues of Roman society. The naming could be considered ironic, given both the amount of pirate activity going on around the planet and the inability of the Citadel Council to reach a final decision on its colonization.
