Description[]
A recently colonized asteroid large enough to be considered a dwarf planet, Rosh is mined for its platinum deposits for use in hydrogen fuel cells. With wide-open spaces and few restrictions on construction or immigration, Rosh is, like much of the Terminus Systems, a good place to build a habitat and get lost for a few decades.
The Reapers did not bother harvesting Rosh. Its spread-out population bought them a few minutes of life because it meant the Reapers had to take three shots rather than one.

Trivia[]
The planet details for Rosh existed within the Mass Effect 2 game files but weren't visible in the game proper for some reason. The planet finally became visible halfway through Mass Effect 3.
