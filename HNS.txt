“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




During the Nexus Uprising, HNS' editor was killed and replaced by Davis Qar. Acting Director Jarun Tann subsequently blamed HNS broadcasts for stirring unrest. 
By the time ark Hyperion reaches the Nexus, HNS is only composed of Davis Qar and one or two freelancers.
In order to spread HNS' reach, Davis attempts to enlist Pathfinder Ryder's help setting up HNS towers across Heleus. The HNS transmitter is long-range and can send packaged data between ships, but it needs planetside receivers for the people down there. Due to the limited number of receivers, HNS can only afford to set up near areas with people.
