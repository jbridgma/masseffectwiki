Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Charge temporarily staggers normal-sized enemies.
Charge can hit floating units unless said units are flying away from the map too fast due to being hit with prior skills.
Target units must be as unobstructed as possible between them and the Charging character or else the skill doesn't initiate and a "target obstructed" status report is displayed. If a target is hiding behind a stack of crates, for example, if the crosshairs turn red on any exposed part this could be a sufficient enough window to Charge in.
Strategies
As with earlier iterations in the original trilogy, Charge is part of Vanguard characters' main assault methodology, rewarding distance-closing with shield restoration and a detonator for primed targets. It is one of the skills to be given priority in maximizing, if not the first, in any Vanguard-type character.
