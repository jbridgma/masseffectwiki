The book opens with a page-long introduction by game director Casey Hudson, and is then divided into five parts. Each part contains artworks of all kinds, ranging from felt sketches to 3D renders of characters and environments. According to art director Derek Watts in the Beyond the Game documentary, Casey Hudson wrote all of the book's commentary "in like a week."[1]
