Capabilities[]
Offensive
Shadow Broker Engineers are equipped with the M-6 Carnifex and have the Combat Drone and Incinerate abilities.
Defensive
Shadow Broker Engineers have moderate health and shielding. They also have access to the Tech Armor ability.

Tactics[]
Engineers are fond of using their Incinerate and Combat Drone abilities so make sure to either keep in cover when they use the former, and shoot the drone when they use the latter.
Engineers also have access to Tech Armor, so they can have additional defenses.
Energy Drain is useful to quickly lower their shields, whilst contributing to your own.
