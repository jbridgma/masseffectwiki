Description[]
Gromar is a rocky, terrestrial world with a trace atmosphere of krypton and xenon. The frozen surface is mainly composed of copper with deposits of calcium.
Prior to the Alliance's expansion into the Voyager Cluster, Gromar hosted half of a turian interferometric telescope array. Connected with similar telescope in the Attican Beta cluster by an expensive chain of FTL comm buoys, the two functioned as a virtual "lens" with an effective aperture equal to the thousands of light years between them. The turians used this to map the Terminus Systems with great accuracy.

Survey Text[]

“Scans of the planet Gromar revealed a derelict space station in late stages of orbital decay. A small team was able to recover some items of interest. Among them, a League of One medallion.”

Trivia[]
In the original version of Mass Effect, the description erroneously spells the planet's home cluster as the "Voyage Cluster". The error has since been corrected in Mass Effect Legendary Edition.
