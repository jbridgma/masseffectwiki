Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Nexus Reunion

Speak to Nigel McCoy (marked with a) in the Cryo Bay aboard the Hyperion. Note:  You must speak to him before Meridian: The Way Home as the cryo bay will become unavailable after that mission.

Walkthrough[]
Like many tasks, this is a simple "go to location and complete the objective" one. You aren't even given an in-game model of the object you're supposed to be transporting, the mission just completes once you interact with the marker at the mission location.

Place pendant at the location on Eos[]
From Site 1: Promise, follow the tire tracks leading west, drive uphill, then turn right and follow the edge of the cliff until you reach the map marker. Interact with the location of the map marker to place the pendant. 
Aftermath[]
Nigel sends you an email after mission completion. He also disappears from the cryo bay.




The brothers McCoy
To: Ryder
FromÂ [sic] Nigel McCoy

Dear Pathfinder Ryder,

My brother Dash was my best friend. It still pains me that he's gone, that we won't build the future here in Andromeda together. But knowing that our family pendants are united does my heart good.

When my wife and I settle here and start a family, our firstborn will carry my brother's name. And hopefully he or she will become my new best friend.

My sincerest hopes accompany you and your team.


Nigel
