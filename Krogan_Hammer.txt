Description[]
A brutal weapon, the incredible force of this mechanized hammer is enhanced by precision pistons and mass effect fields. Such hammers are commonly used by elder krogan warlords, though this particular model has been modified for especially strong humans or young krogan.

Features[]
The Krogan Hammer is tied with the Asari Sword as the game's most powerful melee weapon. Unlike other melee weapons that attack horizontally, the Krogan Hammer is swung vertically, resulting in the wielder smashing it into the ground with enough force to knock back human-sized enemies a significant distance upon a successful hit. The shockwave unleashed by the impact covers a significant area, enough to hit multiple enemies around the wielder, dealing full damage to all of them in the process and making it the best melee weapon choice for crowd control purposes.
However, this weapon is comparatively slow. It takes about a second and more from upswing (prepping the hammer) to downswing (dealing damage), which in battlefield conditions translates to plenty of time to be counterattacked, or for the intended target to slip away.
Three characters can wield the Krogan Hammer: Pathfinder Ryder, Nakmor Drack, and the Krogan Gladiator.

Strategies[]
A Vanguard Ryder is well-suited to wielding the Krogan Hammer, mainly because they gain significant bonuses to melee damage, which the hammer excels at.
The knockback feature of the Hammer is useful for temporarily incapacitating troublesome enemies. Again, this is perfect for a Vanguard, who can Charge the enemy for an first strike, then follow up with Nova and a Hammer strike for a truly devastating opening attack.
Some enemies can be instantly killed by the knockback feature of the Hammer, provided they are close enough to a given ledge over an accompanying abyss.
The Hammer's knockback effect works through obstacles and cover. Use this feature to stagger hunkered-down enemies out of cover for follow-up attacks, but keep in mind that the Hammer's immense damage quickly destroys most pieces of cover completely, making it impossible for Ryder to use that cover themselves afterwards.
Running towards the target then using the hammer helps offset its slowness as forward momentum propels the character while the weapon animation is executing. Dashing, however, doesn't as there is a momentary pause between the end of the dash and the start of the upswing animation.
