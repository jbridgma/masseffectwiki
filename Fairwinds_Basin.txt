Fairwinds Basin is an area on Eos far southwest of Site 1: Promise and Site 2: Resilience. It is bounded to the north and west by The Sheartop, to the east by a Remnant monolith, and to the south by unlabelled territory between it and Outland Spire. 
The area is defined by tall cliffs surrounding flat terrain and two bodies of water. A Forward Station site next to a cave entrance to the Sheartop overlooks the entire basin. Apart from ample amounts of water and sparse vegetation, there are also a few fluorite nodes in the basin.
According to Grace Lito, Fairwinds Basin has the lowest radiation count in the region. However, its surrounding areas except to the east all have elevated radiation levels, discouraging further exploration for the time being.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




When the world's Remnant vault has been reset, dropping radiation levels across Eos, the basin is chosen to be the site of the Andromeda Initiative's third Eos outpost (and first successful one): Prodromos. Nakmor Drack formally joins the Pathfinder team here after jointly defeating kett marauders.
