The Zakera Cafe is a location in the Citadel. Managed by a turian shopkeeper, this cafe is located on the 27th level of a building in Zakera Ward's Mid-Wards District. Though a small selection of items are available for purchase at the cafe's kiosk, Avina doesn't recognize it as a store.

Trivia[]
Whenever Commander Shepard visits the cafe, the turian shopkeeper is engaged in a conversation with a human customer. The customer is buying cooking supplies for a dinner he has with a date, and ends up purchasing asari honey marinade from an Ardat-Yakshi monastery. The shopkeeper also recommends to a human customer that he go to the nearby Fishdog Food Factory and purchase their Tummy Tingling Tuchanka Sauce. This was after the customer showed ignorance in his knowledge of spice chirality. The Fishdog Food Factory is further mentioned in the Citadel DLC by Grunt when he is drunk in the shower and its location is shown during Citadel Wards: Ambush right after Shepard exits the markets en route to Cision Motors.
Two of the listed items for purchase at the cafe's kiosk for 5 credits each are called "Ascension Novel" and "Revelations Novel", written by human author Drew Karpyshyn. Drew Karpyshyn is one of the original lead writers of the Mass Effect series, and Mass Effect: Ascension and Mass Effect: Revelation are both actual novels written by him.
