(Hidden manufacturer only accessible with the PC Cheats using the PC Console)
A rising star of post-contact human industry, Jormangund returns consistent profits through aggressive integration of alien technologies. Mainly known for advanced optical computers and AI "blueboxes", the company has recently developed a "micro gravitic" personal weapon that effectively fires small disruptor torpedoes.
If any member of the squad is wearing Crisis or Hazard Armor, it will negate the timer on environments with Level 1 or 2 environmental hazards. This effect is similar to but more powerful than that provided by Devlon Industries armor. 
Jormangund armors possess the highest shields of all armors. Since they are not normally attainable in the game, the actual distinction goes to the runner-up Predator L/M/H Armors of Armax Arsenal. Crisis and Hazard armors rank third in damage protection after Cerberus Skunkworks armors and Colossus Armor, and also rank third in tech/biotic protection after Predator L/M/H Armor and Cerberus Skunkworks armors.
