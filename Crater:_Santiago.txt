“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




Crater: Santiago is the entrance to a Remnant conservatory in H-047c. It is located northwest of Crater: Idriya in the landmass far southwest of the Tempest, along the west/northwest portion of a vehicle trail south of the Lethe Rift. Idriya and Santiago are the two major points of interest that are unmarked on the world's map.
Outlaws have discovered the place given the presence of Initiative technology and the mining dome itself, though there is no evidence of outlaw activity beyond the gravity well to the underground facility.
In the immediate outskirts of the crater, to the north among a jutting pile of medium-sized boulders is a basic mining zone. Nearby to the east but outside the crater's jurisdiction is a rare mining zone.
