Description[]
The asari have set up research stations on the largest moon of Tritogenith, a gas giant, in order to observe the eventual collision of Promavess and Sotera. A Reaper troop transport can be seen here, indicating that the Reapers sent a small force to capture or kill the station's staff. Why they did not destroy the station outright is a mystery. It could be that the direct collision of two planets is so rare that even the Reapers wish to observe the results.
