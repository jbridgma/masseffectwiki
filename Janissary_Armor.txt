(This armor can only be obtained with the PC Cheats using the PC Console)
Janissary Armor is manufactured by the Hahne-Kedar Shadow Works. It has fairly high damage protection and shields, but low biotic and tech protection.
Janissary Armor is available for humans, krogan and turians.
Apparently the armor is just a prototype, as the light, medium and heavy variations have no physical difference and it shares the same values as Spectre Armor, also produced by Hahne-Kedar Shadow Works.
