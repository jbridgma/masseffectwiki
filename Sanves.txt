Description[]
The hospitable nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, temperate-climate and sprawling wilderness of Sanves made the planet a popular tourist destination. Large tracks of untamed forest surrounding the capital drew in millions of sightseers, game hunters, and biologists. The asari, mindful of how rapid expansion has damaged the ecologies of other planets, restricted settlements.
After destroying the colony's navy and antiair defenses, Reapers landed infantry units to subjugate the local population. Destroyers keep watch in orbit, the capital ships apparently elsewhere fighting bigger battles.
