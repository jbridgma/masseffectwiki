Description[]
Paphos, a hydrogen-helium gas giant with a significant amount of nitrogen, is named for a prominent asari lawgiver. Her treatise on the reluctance of democracies to go to war with other democracies formed a key tenet of asari political theory that led to Thessia's modern golden age.
The planet itself was only notable for orbital stations that fueled transport ships by skimming deuterium and helium-3. The Reapers destroyed the stations, killing the inhabitants.
