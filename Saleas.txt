Description[]
Saleas' cratered surface is ancient; parts of the highlands have been unchanged for nearly three billion years. The layers of overlapping craters stand as testament to the violence of the system's creation. Saleas is tidally locked to Elysta and has a trace atmosphere of krypton and xenon, with helium constantly "blowing in" via solar winds.
