Description[]
A modestly sized hydrogen-helium Jovian planet, Joppa is close enough and reflective enough to be seen in Elysium's night sky. It orbits in retrograde, possibly indicating that it was an extrasolar capture. Human and alien consortiums compete fiercely for the rights to gather helium-3 from the planet, since Elysium's favorable position along trade routes means high profits.

Trivia[]
It is likely that Joppa was named after a city in what is now Israel, similar to how most other locations in the Petra Nebula, including the nebula itself, are named after locations in the Levant.
