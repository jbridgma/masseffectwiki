Description[]
Odasst has an abundance of heavy metals and radioactives. It is heavily exploited by mining concerns based on Illium. Forty-three years ago, a Council Spectre arrived to investigate reports that the businesses were selling platinum - a strategic metal - to pirate groups in the Terminus Systems. The results of the investigation were never released, but no deaths were reported.
