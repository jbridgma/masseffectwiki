Description[]
Mahavid is a metallic asteroid in the very sparse Nahata Belt. It has a high nickel and iron content in the form of kamacite. The rights to mine Mahavid belong to T-GES Mineral Works, who sell their products primarily to the colonists of Arvuna. A close fly-by reveals light emanating from its facilities.
