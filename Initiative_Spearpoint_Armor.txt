Description[]
Standard-issue Andromeda Initiative hardsuits are designed for exploration as much as combat, combining jump-jets, high-grade external and internal sensors, and a variety of atmospheric filters with the usual kinetic barrier generators and ceramic armor plating. Personnel equipped in these suits can enter and leave alien biomes without fear of contamination-or hostile wildlife.

At Ranks III & IV, the existing description changes to remove the last sentence and replaces it with the following text: "Upgraded hardsuits record vast amounts of environmental data and have increased damage absorption capacity."
At Ranks V - X, the existing description changes to remove the last sentence and replaces it with the following text: "This particular suit has been customized according to specific hazard data gathered from the Heleus Cluster."
Types[]
Ranks I - X are named Initiative when the four armor pieces are crafted.
When the four armor pieces are found in-game:

Ranks I-II are named Initiative.
Ranks III-IV are named Initiative Recon.
Ranks V-X are named Initiative Spearpoint.
Note:  There are no differences between the found versions compared to the crafted versions (other than visual).
