Batalla is colonized by batarians and elcor. While its worlds only have a moderate to good resource rating, it is one of few systems that host multiple extractable element zero deposits: Nearog's moons was once a home to a pirate warlord, and Thunawanuro's denizens are surprisingly productive considering their interstellar neighborhood.
