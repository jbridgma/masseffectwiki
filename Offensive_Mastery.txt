Player Notes[]
Rank 4 presents a choice between damage/force for powers or additional duration.  More damage and force benefits Warp, Throw, and Overload; greater duration benefits Warp and the freeze/chill length of Cryoblast.  If you use Warp more for the damaging effects, or rely on Overload as a primary attack, the Damage and Force bonus is the better choice.  The damage of Power Combos is not enhanced by power damage bonuses, but duration bonuses on the other hand may keep targets "primed" for such combos longer.  Also keep in mind what bonus power you are using, e.g. Dominate can benefit from additional duration but not damage.
The Rank 5 Squad Bonus evolution applies only to NPC squad members and not to Shepard. There is possibility for confusion, as the similarly named "Squad Bonus" evolutions of squadmates' class powers apply to the entire party including Shepard and also the owner of the power.
