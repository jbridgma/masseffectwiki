The arknid, also colloquially known as the spitbug, is an insect that resembles a tick scaled to dog-sized proportions. It can be found natively on Eos and Elaaden.
These malodorous creatures emit an acid that is highly corrosive, strong enough to eat through a gun. Some outlaws have been conducting research to weaponize their goo into grenades.

Scanner Information[]
Arknid, AKA Spitbug


DATA:
Classification: Insect
Origin: Andromeda
ANALYSIS:
An oversized, hard-shelled insect that spits acid when threatened. Not innately hostile. Bristles along its body and legs sense movement, as well as scents. 

Capabilities[]
Offensive
Spitbugs spew projectile acid as their only means of attack. It is only viable at short to medium ranges.

Defensive
Spitbugs are unprotected by shields, armor, or barriers.

Tactics[]
Spitbugs can simply be run over with the ND1 Nomad. More effort is required to keep them alive as they have very low health and can be killed by errant squadmate fire.
