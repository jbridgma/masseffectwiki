Aldrin Labs is a human manufacturer based on the Luna colony. Providing basic, reliable equipment at an affordable cost has made them a primary supplier of armor, omni-tools and bio-amps to the Systems Alliance military. Aldrin Labs also manufactures the hand-held stunners that are mandatory for all Ascension Project staff to carry.
They make three lines of armor: Agent (turian), Hydra (human, quarian) and Onyx (human, krogan, quarian, turian).
An armory license for Aldrin Labs can be purchased from the C-Sec Requisitions Officer for 100 credits.

Trivia[]
The name may be a reference to American astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second man to set foot on the Moon.

↑ Mass Effect official Prima guide, page 44: Aldrin Labs' Kinetic Plastite gives a -7 in Damage Protection (incorrectly listed as -7%), -30% in Shields, and -10% in Hardening. The first two are verified, but calculations for the third don't match, even though there's a visible reduction compared to baseline stats.

↑ Mass Effect official Prima guide, page 44: Aldrin Labs' Encryption Overlay gives a -10 in Shields Bonus (incorrectly displayed in the Armor column), and a -10 in both Cooldown Bonus and Med Recharge Bonus (both incorrectly shown as -10%). The calculations match when compared to baseline stats.

↑ Mass Effect official Prima guide, page 44: Aldrin Labs' Neural Sequencer gives a -10 in Duration, Power and Cooldown Bonuses (all incorrectly shown as -10%). The calculations match when compared to baseline stats.
