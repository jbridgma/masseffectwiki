An asari military trainer needs texts from the Library of Asha. Recover the texts from the Nimbus Cluster and deliver them to her at Purgatory on the Citadel.
Alternative journal entry:
Ancient asari texts were recovered from the Library of Asha in the Nimbus Cluster. Find someone on the Citadel who can use them.

Acquisition[]
Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II

Head to Purgatory and listen to the comm onversation of an asari standing on the right side of the staircase leading up to the Dance Floor. She feels her people need a refresher on the ways of the huntress, as many of them are dancing instead of fighting.
Alternatively, the artifacts and the mission's journal entry can be acquired during a Search and Rescue operation. The mission is then labeled as Citadel: Library of Asha.

Walkthrough[]

To retrieve the texts, scan Carcosa regardless of mission acquisition method. It is in the Agaiou system.
Deliver the Library of Asha texts to the Military Trainer. Doing this nets you +5 Reputation, 15,000 credits, and an update to the Asari Sixth Fleet War Asset. If you talk to her again she wants the texts to be required reading as she wants every maiden thinking like a huntress, adding she has Matriarch Aethyta's backing on the issue.

Bugs[]
The asari military trainer may not be shown on your map.
