Description[]
The Valiant is a sniper rifle tested by Alliance soldiers during a series of harsh survival exercises on the planet Kruljaven. This streamlined weapon employs a sophisticated fire-control system that improves accuracy by stabilizing the barrel during targeting. Although this comes at the cost of reduced capacity and rate of fire, most soldiers find the increase in precision and quick reloading time a worthy tradeoff.

Acquisition[]
Single-player
The N7 Valiant is included in the N7 Collector's Edition Pack as a bonus item for players who order the Collector's or Digital Deluxe Edition of Mass Effect 3. An e-mail is received as part of the acquisition package.




N7 Weaponry


From: Lt. D. Eugene

Commander Shepard:

Your VI, EDI, put in a request to me for a handful of N7-grade weapons. Happy to oblige. I led the engineers who retrofitted the Normandy when it was turned over to the Alliance. EDI kept me company when we were overhauling the Normandy's interior. She's a beautiful ship, Commander. I'll miss working on her.

I left the guns in your weapons locker.

Best of luck,
Lieutenant D. Eugene

Alliance Engineering Corp.



In the Legendary Edition it is available from the Spectre Requisitions terminal in the Citadel Embassies for a base amount of 250,000 credits. 

Multiplayer
Weapons are randomly rewarded through purchases of item packs. The N7 Valiant is categorized as ultra-rare and requires no multiplayer expansion packs.

Player Notes[]
GeneralSingle-player
General
The N7 Valiant is a multi-shot sniper rifle whose damage per shot is greater than the M-97 Viper but less than the M-92 Mantis. It possesses a far higher rate of fire than either, especially when its fast reload speed is factored in; reload cancelling is not really necessary. The Valiant also carries a significant reserve of spare thermal clips.
A level 1 Valiant is fairly heavy, weighing more than the M-99 Saber assault rifle. However, the Valiant becomes significantly lighter at higher levels, eventually weighing much less than a Saber of equal rank. A high or max level Valiant has one of the best power-to-weight ratios of any weapon, making it attractive for almost any class or build.
The Valiant is comparable with the M-77 Paladin, as both weapons deal similar damage per shot and possess 3 shot clips by default. The Valiant has superior rate of fire and long range accuracy but weighs more, and it is more difficult to use against fast moving targets at close range. While the Valiant is accurate enough to fire effectively from the hip, like almost all sniper rifles it will suffer a significant damage penalty.
The N7 Valiant has very low recoil, much less than that of the Black Widow. This enables it to fire with speed and precision. When fired at its maximum rate, it can exceed the damage-per-second (DPS) of the Black Widow against soft targets, though it lacks the Black Widow's one-shot kill potential as well as its native shot penetration.
The Valiant's rate of fire is more than fast enough to discharge all three rounds before the damage bonus of Tactical Cloak expires.
The Valiant works better by default against shielded light enemies such as Geth Hunters and Centurions than most single-shot sniper rifles, as it will suffer less from the shield gate mechanic, especially on higher difficulties.
Single-player
The Valiant works excellently with a Sniper Rifle Concentration Mod: with the time dilation for each shot, you can land quick headshots with a rapid rate of fire and quick reload. The mod also provides a significant damage bonus. Adrenaline Rush or the Infiltrator's Operational Mastery passive can also provide time dilation.
The Valiant is a poor choice for squadmates, as they do not take advantage of the weapon's full potential rate of fire. The heavy sniper rifles like the Black Widow, M-98 Widow, or Javelin are better options.
In Legendary Edition, the Valiant is the most expensive weapon, costing 250,000 credits; however, after the initial purchase, the cost to upgrade it is basically the same as that of any other gun. With a great deal of spending discipline and completion of all side missions, it's possible to afford the Valiant before Priority: Tuchanka. It helps to be diligent about scanning all clusters for war assets as soon as they become available on the galaxy map, which will reveal a lot of credits early in the game; taking the store discount option from the remains of a Reaper destroyer on Borr may also be useful. Remember that buying the weapon from the Citadel directly is cheaper than buying from the Normandy.

Description[]
This semi-automatic sniper rifle has a sophisticated fire-control system that improves accuracy at the cost of reduced capacity. In the Milky Way, N7 soldiers generally found the Valiant's increased precision and quick reloads a worthy trade-off.

Features[]
