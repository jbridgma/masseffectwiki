The Armali Council is an affiliation of asari manufacturing guilds recognized for maintaining consistent standards of excellence. Armali make high-grade omni-tools and their bio-amps are widely recognized as the finest money can buy, though these are only available to a select list of clients able to obtain a license to their wares.







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.





Commander Shepard meets a representative of the Armali Council on Noveria, Mallene Calis, who asks for help conducting industrial espionage on Binary Helix. An Armali Council license can be purchased from Commander Rentola on Virmire. It is supposed to be obtainable from Nassana Dantius with sufficient persuasion once her sister has been dealt with, but the license is not awarded due to a bug.

Trivia[]
In the first Mass Effect game, Mallene Calis makes mention of the Aramali City Council and all in-game descriptions of the manufacturer's products also go by the "Aramali" spelling. The alternate term does not appear in any subsequent media.
