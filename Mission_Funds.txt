Mission Funds are an alternative currency in the Andromeda Galaxy. It is used by APEX Strike Teams.

Overview[]
Mission Funds are earned by Strike Teams or by multiplayer groups only after a successful APEX Missions.
Missions funds can be used in three different ways:

Purchasing new Strike Teams
Equipping existing Strike Teams
Purchasing specific Equipment in the Store for Multiplayer Characters.
Note: Mass Effect: Andromeda Multiplayer uses another currency, Credits  that can be used to buy different boxes of Equipment for Multiplayer Characters. Those Multiplayer credits are on a different account than the credits used by Pathfinder Ryder in Single-Player.
