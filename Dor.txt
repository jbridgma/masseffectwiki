Description[]
Dor is a conventional methane-ammonia ice giant. It is the main fueling port in the Dranek cluster gateway system. Pildea Station, the headquarters for patrol ships of the Council Demilitarization Enforcement Mission (CDEM), lies at the trailing Lagrange point of Dor.
The CDEM logs all ships passing through the Krogan Demilitarized Zone, and has the right to board and search them for contraband at any time and for any reason. There are no exceptions; at points over the last two centuries, diplomatic incidents have been caused when the patrol frigates boarded an asari hospital ship, a batarian diplomatic courier, and privately-owned human "tramp" freighters.
These measures are provided for under the terms of the krogan armistice. While the krogan were allowed to retain their government and personal weapons, any attempt to provide starship-mounted weapons to the clans on Tuchanka is punishable by law. Nearly a millennia [sic] after the war ended, the official penalty for smuggling proscribed weapons is still death by spacing.
