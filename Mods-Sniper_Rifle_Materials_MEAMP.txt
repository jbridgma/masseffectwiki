Acquisition[]
Mods are acquired and upgraded through purchases of packs and items in the multiplayer Store.

Basic - SR Ultra-Light Materials: Superior lightweight alloys replace weapon parts, making the weapon less obtrusive and easier to handle.
Enhanced - SR Experimental Materials: Substantially reduces weapon weight, but at the cost of increased recoil.
Enhanced - SR Latticed Materials: Substantially reduces weapon weight, but at the cost of decreased clip size.
Note:  Sniper rifle stability is not reflected in the displayed weapon stats.
