Description[]
The Worthington is a Kowloon Class modular conveyor of human design, configured for mixed freight and passenger hauling. The ship appears to be in shut down state; the main thrusters are cold, and it is adrift off the orbit of Antiroprus.
Registry: The Morrison Company, Shanxi

Assignments[]
Assignment: UNC: Lost Freighter







“This mission just got a lot more complicated.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect follow.




Mass Effect[]
The Worthington had at least four crew members - the captain, a doctor named Smith, and two other crewmen, Jacob and his biotic girlfriend Julia - though the crew quarters have room for more than twenty.
Commander Shepard's team finds the Worthington apparently deserted and heavily booby-trapped, with Jacob hooked up to life support in the medical room, though his brain activity is flat-lined. Shepard can read the crew logs in the medical room, crew quarters and cockpit to piece together what happened there.

Trivia[]
Possibly due to the investigative nature of the UNC: Lost Freighter assignment, in the game files, the Worthington is referred to as the 'CSI' freighter.
