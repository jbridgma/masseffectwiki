Much of Faia has seen heavy industrialization due to its abundant resources and local garden world Zorya. Water, helium-3, and Zorya's biota all fetch tidy profits in local and offsystem markets. The only exception is Imaen, although it still has deposits obtainable by the Normandy SR-2.
The economic competition, however, is severely cutthroat. The Blue Suns hold home-court advantage owing to their home office in Zorya.

Trivia[]
Early drafts of this game had Faia as the gateway system to the Ismar Frontier. By the time of release, this had been changed to Aquila as the gateway system. There are some references, holdovers from the first drafts, in the final game to Faia, not Aquila, as the gateway system.
