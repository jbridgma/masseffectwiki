Message from Suvi 
To: Ryder
From: Suvi

Hey,

Meet me on the laboratory on the Nexus. I have something I want to show you!

You'll love it. Promise!


Suvi


Suvi invites you to meet her at the laboratory on the Nexus.

Meet Suvi at the Nexus tech labs[]
Head to the Nexus Tech Labs. Suvi wants to show you her findings about life in the Heleus Cluster. You will have several interrupt opportunities to advance the romance with Suvi during this conversation.
Once the conversation is over, the mission ends.

Rewards[]
None
Trivia[]
Although Suvi is only available to the female Ryder as a romantic partner, the illustrations for this mission in the game guide published by Prima show Suvi interacting with the male Ryder. This leaves open the question as to whether Suvi might have at one point been intended as a romantic option for the male Ryder, too, or if a non-romance friend version of this mission was at one point planned for the male Ryder.
