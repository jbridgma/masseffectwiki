Description[]
Aganju is an extremely large rock planet with a thin atmosphere of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Abundant in both copper and platinum, the crust has been scanned by mining bots from Erinle, but the specialized equipment to work in Aganju's heavy gravity (more than 5 G's) has created prohibitive costs, and so Aganju is largely unexploited.
