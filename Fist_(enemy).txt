Fist is an agent of the Shadow Broker who sold out to Saren Arterius. Because of this, he has numerous people gunning for his head and has prepared accordingly, holing up inside his club Chora's Den and employing numerous guards who may also pull double duty as the club's employees. 
Commander Shepard storms Chora's Den during the course of looking for evidence that will expose Saren's crimes. Fist is cornered in his office, his men and drones no match for the prospective Spectre. 
Fist gives up crucial intel in exchange for his life. If Urdnot Wrex is with Shepard, the krogan executes the turncoat to fulfill the bounty placed on him by the Shadow Broker. Otherwise, Shepard can either let him go free or shoot him.

Tactics[]
Fist is armed only with a pistol and defended with Shield Boost. On higher difficulties he has Immunity. He activates either defensive talent when losing his shields.
Fist's office only has him and two Defensive Turrets. Destroying both turrets or Fist himself ends the fight.
Trivia[]
Fist's listed abilities include Marksman, although he never uses the talent in combat under any circumstance and instead relies on standard rapid-fire shooting.
