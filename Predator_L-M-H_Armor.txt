For standard Predator Armor produced by Hahne-Kedar, see Predator Armor.
Predator L/M/H Armor is manufactured by Armax Arsenal and comes in human, turian, and krogan models. Shepard can procure the armory license for Armax Arsenal from Expat, the volus merchant in the Wards' market district.
Thanks to its woven armalite, Predator L/M/H Armor has the highest shields and nearly the highest tech/biotic resistance of all human and turian armors attainable without console commands.[1] It is considered one of the top two regularly acquirable armors, the other being Colossus Armor. Predator L/M/H Armor has lower damage resistance than Colossus Armor, but higher shields and tech/biotic resistance. It has a green camouflage pattern.
