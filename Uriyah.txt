Description[]
Tikkun's asteroid belt is home to Uriyah, a rock large enough to qualify as a binary dwarf planet. Its companion, Etiel, is believed to have split off from the main body after an oblique impact. Both were heavily mined early in the age of quarian space exploration. Curiously, the geth have built over the old quarian space stations, even though the mined-out asteroids have little obvious use. The current theory is that they provide a staging base to exploit other asteroids in the belt.
