Gender
Male


Appearances
Mass Effect: Andromeda


Tseek is a member of the Resistance on Voeld. He shares lookout duties with Beniska on the Angaran Resistance Base. Their post overlooks the valley and has a view of the planet's Kett Base, and since they were stationed there for a long time they're considered experts on local activities.







“Make no mistake — this is a one-way trip.” — Spoilers for Mass Effect: Andromeda follow.




It appears that he has a good relationship with Beniska, regularly bantering to break the tedium. The latter shows concern for his sister, who was experiencing nightmares even after physically recovering from something traumatic. Tseek tells Beniska the only thing they can do for his sister is being there when needed. He loves the view of the valley contrary to his partner, who's merely used to seeing it.
Tseek and Beniska are startled on meeting Pathfinder Ryder for the first time, as the latter came up on their backs, which forces them to initially draw weapons. Tseek acts as the more level-headed of the two and tries reining his partner in, since Beniska either snubs the Pathfinder or tries too hard at a welcome depending on Ryder's reputation. If Ryder deems Beniska's attitude awkward in case they already helped on Havarl, Tseek smugly tells Beniska the Pathfinder agrees with him, causing her to grumble.
Whichever the case, Tseek takes over speaking duties for most of the Pathfinder's queries. He doesn't know anything Remnant-related, however, as he doesn't read the daily reports. He prefers hearing what he needs to know from Beniska.
If Jaal Ama Darav is in Ryder's squad Tseek inquires if his sister has recovered from her mission, calling her brave.
