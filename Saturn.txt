Description[]
Saturn has been a major source of helium-3 fuel for fusion plants since the 2150s. The moon of Titan is mined for hydrocarbons, and used as a hostile environment training facility for Alliance Marines.

Trivia[]
For gas giants, day length refers to the internal magnetic dynamo; and that of Saturn is still not well-constrained.[1]
Huygens Dome is likely named after 17th Century Dutch astronomer and physicist  Christiaan Huygens, famed for discovering Titan, one of the moons of Saturn, as well as several nebulae. Huygens was also one of the first scientists to speculate on the possibility of life on other planets. In addition to Huygens Dome, a Martian crater, a Lunar mountain, an asteroid, and a joint American-European space probe have been named after Huygens.
Fort Charles Upham, an Alliance Marine training ground where Hostile Environment Assault Training is conducted, is based on Saturn's moon of Titan. If asked in Mass Effect, Ashley Williams tells Commander Shepard about her own training experience on Titan. Ashley relates how after first landing on Titan, she stepped out onto the moon's surface, full of wonder at being the first person to ever stand on that spot, and was immediately kicked in the backside by her drill instructor for goldbricking.
