Player Notes[]
Mechanics
Grenade powers do not have a recharge time and, thus, can be used immediately at any time, provided grenades are available. Using the power consumes one grenade each time.
If the player has multiple grenade powers, the grenade pool is shared between them.
This power works along the same principle as the multiplayer Ops Survival Pack supply item. Like the Survival Packs, the power can be accessed regardless of recharge stage and used at any time, but it has a limited supply. However, this supply can be replenished at ammo drops like grenade powers, unlike the Survival Packs.
Unlike Ops Survival Packs, Stimulant Packs do not replenish health.
Stimulant Packs offers a brief immunity period upon consumption, much like Ops Survival Packs grant after use.
Strategy
This power benefits from Gear items that increase the number of grenades that a player can carry. Choosing the Rank 5 extra Stimulant Pack upgrade and equipping the level V Grenade Capacity Gear enables the player to carry as many as eight Stimulant Packs at a time.
It is highly recommended to either equip grenade upgrades to carry extra Stimulant Packs or carry a high capacity weapon during long firefights or when ammo supplies are limited because of shared resources (i.e. when other players use nearby ammo boxes during escort, data upload, or extraction objectives).
Availability[]
Single-player: Urdnot Wrex
Multiplayer: Turian Havoc Soldier, Turian Ghost Infiltrator
Trivia[]
If Wrex has no packs available for the Stimulant Pack ability, the power wheel text will display "No grenades", as if stimulant packs were grenades.
